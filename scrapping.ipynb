Also went for friends birthday and the service was Amazing! Big thank you to Chloe I believe was her name for the great service!  Overpriced. Pay close attention when paying check. Tip is pre added and I ended up tipping generously to a server who had horrible service.  The food was great. The meat selections were exquisite and the atmosphere was very fun.

If there’s any complaints, then the parking situation has to be the worst. Because there is no valet or parking structures nearby, you have to search for parking on the street. Getting dropped off is definitely a better option. I also suggest a better menu presentation, get rid of the disposable paper menus. Thank you for the great dinner experience. Cheers! Read more Service was terrible honestly. Food was mediocre and over priced. I paid $20 for asparagus only to not eat them because they were severely overcooked and mushy. I ordered the surf and turf and could tell the lobster was just sitting however the steak was piping hot. All in all, spent $450+ when I definitely would’ve had a better experience at Chili’s.

If you tell me my meal is $52 and I pay $5.20 on tax, that feels less deceptive, and the staff may even get an additional tip. Read more Food was great as usual.\n",
      "Just a lil upset I didn’t get a bday treat :(  Always such a wonderful experience. Staff is so great and attentive. This is what keeps us coming back.  Fun place for a special occasion. Dinner AND a show makes the high cost ALMOST bearable! We had a good time, good meal, & they DID make a birthday celebration memorable. 👌👍  Very disappointing experience ..server was very dry and uninviting. Food although was a nice amount was very bland except for the rice, which was pretty tasty. Calamari tasted as if it were cooked in old Grease with brown burnt seasonings on the outside. The soup Had a weird flavor could not eat it at all. ￼ Not sure if this is the standard of service since they get their 20% off the top. ￼ Will not be returning, good luck to others. Read more Great food and drinks. The chef had funny jokes and made the experience fun.  When we first walked in we were greeted very nicely. But we didn’t  know we would have to be sharing a table with people if we didn’t have at least 8 people so it was kind of weird. The food needs more flavour since it didn’t taste like anything much. The sushi was very good though. The Tapanyaki show needs to be more lively. The scallops we were given were uncooked it was still smooshy on the inside. Also the server gave us the wrong check and gave the check that was supposed to be given to  the two other people who were seated next to us. Read more We all had a great time. My son tends to be a little expensive and ordered lobster and steak. I really appreciated that the waiter came back and checked in with us to make sure that was okay. The only downside is we felt a little rushed. Before I could even try the soup they were taken away and about 5 min after I was served my chicken they were coming around with a cake and boxes. Read more The experience was one of the best that I’ve had in a very long time. I traveled from the Sacramento area to visit this particular location because my family lives in Alameda and I was completely impressed with the service that we received on my son‘s birthday. I would not hesitate to travel from Sacramento to visit this particular restaurant again thank you so much for your hospitality. Read more\n",

      "The Peking duck was not special at all  Great service and menus. Great food. Excellent selections  Our family of 5, up from LA to visit our UC Berkeley freshman, and including a very picky 11 year-old, were all so happy with our time at China Live! We were seated in the store area and found it quite fun. Our server was helpful and friendly and kind. The cocktails and wine were fantastic. The food was out of this world!

We will be back on our next visit to San Francisco! Read more We always love coming here! It’s a great & delicious restaurant! And everything is fresh!  Great Dining Experience\n",
      "Wonderful Food & Service!  This place is overpriced, and a terrible take on Chinese cuisine. Everything I had was under seasoned, over cooked, over sauced lacking in everything.  The only thing enjoyable about this restaurant was the waiting staff. I would never recommend this place to anyone. You can easily spend half the amount of money somewhere else in San Francisco and get 100% better quality food. Read more Food was good but not a five star restaurant. This is more of a tourist stop. The atmosphere was unique with its different stations but it was too loud for it to be a relaxing meal. Soup dumplings, peking duck and sea bass were good, amaretto bread pudding was delicious.  Fantastic food, drinks, and service! Will definitely be back  Great food, however we were recommended to order 2 dishes each. Way too much food. \n",

First time here…great service, food and drinks. Definitely the best restaurant in Alameda. The only con was it was very busy, crowded and loud.  Trabocco is our favorite restaurant! We are never disappointed! Always amazing! Food and service is the best!  Lamb shank special with polenta was fall off the bone !  amazing flavors .  Service always  good.  Sat in patio to open air and they have heaters if we needed them.  Amazing food and service was outstanding excellent drinks too  Staff is always attentive and kind. Food is always yummy. Thank you  Love this restaurant!  My dad comes here all the time and it never disappoints.  Service is top notch, the food is delicious and the whole staff makes you feel welcome.  The best of North Beach found in an Alameda mall of all places!  Extensive, imaginative and flavorful menu served up by personable, professional staff. The pastas compare favorably to the best of San Francisco’s top spots. They happily accommodated our birthday meal decor and celebratory spirit. Restaurant has several rooms to suit multiple needs and tastes, plus an active and craft-worthy bar.   We will return again and again! Read more Very nice dinner experience. Food was very well prepared and they had a nice list of specials in addition to the standard menu. Service was great  Wonderful restaurant, fantastic food, great staff and an amazing chef!! \n",

I don't do this very often, but I actually wrote a hand written card to be mailed to the staff in appreciation of how amazing the evening and experience was. This is THE PLACE to go for a great dinner and experience.  Great vibe. Not your dad’s stuffy steak house . Good food. Fun music . Good drinks  Our host/server was named Chloey.  She provided the best experience for my wife’s birthday.  Came for happy hour and I love their options! Great bites and fun to order a little of everything and share! Also went for friends birthday and the service was Amazing! Big thank you to Chloe I believe was her name for the great service!  Overpriced. Pay close attention when paying check. Tip is pre added and I ended up tipping generously to a server who had horrible service.  The food was great. The meat selections were exquisite and the atmosphere was very fun. Not your typical steak house where it’s dark and very silent, this was the complete opposite.\n",
      "Our server AJ was -amazing. He explained in detail the entire menu and recommended two of his favorite dishes and we ordered one (the sea bass) which was 10/10.\n",
      "He also asked what we were celebrating and we mentioned my brothers birthday. He then surprised us with a whole entire tray of desserts, with my brothers name written on the wood board!

      "Thank you AJ for showing us what great service should be. Read more The food was delicious with quality you can taste! The service was also spot on. If there’s any complaints, then the parking situation has to be the worst. Because there is no valet or parking structures nearby, you have to search for parking on the street. Getting dropped off is definitely a better option. I also suggest a better menu presentation, get rid of the disposable paper menus. Thank you for the great dinner experience. Cheers! Read more Service was terrible honestly. Food was mediocre and over priced. I paid $20 for asparagus only to not eat them because they were severely overcooked and mushy. I ordered the surf and turf and could tell the lobster was just sitting however the steak was piping hot. All in all, spent $450+ when I definitely would’ve had a better experience at Chili’s.

      "Page 1 Comments: Read more It was a beautiful Oakland Saturday night - 80 degrees at least and the place wasn't slammed - too bad. Great roof deck with lovely plantings and space. Some misses on the food (kale caesar without any kale, drinks came after the salad was gone) but the fish tacos were pretty good. Hubby loved his drink (a citrusy bourbon concoction) and mine was good.  The food and  liquor are always great. We always get the fish tacos and the catfish  with rice and beans.  I ordered the whole fish (the most expensive dish on the menu - I think).\n",

      "Hopefully it was just a bad night for the restaurant chefs and this is not always the case. Read more I celebrated my birthday there with friends. Great place to hang with friends. Always popping. Though my food was cold and rice was a little mushy it stil taste great. Everyone else food was delicious. I will be back and I definitely recommend it.  My guy likes the rooftop experience, so when I heard Oeste has rooftop dining, I booked it.  This is a very lively place with a DJ inside on the first floor and rooftop dining enjoys music through speakers. On the loud side, but if you're young it's a great vibe. The food didn't wow me but it was fine. The waitress was busy yet super nice. It's a fun and social atmosphere.  Amazing! Will be back. Love the menu selections. Good morning ☀️ excited to come back and try something new!  Fantastic ambiance, very slow to be seated but server was wonderful, the food was terrible and disappointing. The food was all very very salt forward. We ate the wings, Korean inspired brussels, ceviche, and ceasar salad. The salad was the only truly edible thing. The brussles were very salty and the korean inspired sauce was not anything I would put the word korean on (and I am Korean). The wings were very basic and were spicy without much flavor, aside from the spice and salt. And the ceviche was in a red sauce... Again the space was great. We sat upstairs on the outdoor patio (which is not accessible to wheelchair users from what I could see) and aside from waiting for 5 minutes at the host desk to be acknowledged by anyone including one person I later learned was likely an owner, the service from our waitstaff was timely.\n",

      "After speaking to several friends and folks in the community I learned that Oeste Bar & Cafe is a place where folks go to after they've eaten. That said, the drinks on the menu all seemed very sweet... perhaps to balance out the food... I am a whiskey drinker and there was a decent selection of bourbon. My partner enjoys wine and in speaking with the server learned that the house wine and bubbly were all sweet, nothing dry. She went with a bottle of Oyster Bay which is a terribly sad option for date night... \n",

By the time I would get to the front of the line, I probably would’ve missed my reservation.

      "Page 3 Comments: Read more This was the best foodie's choice, best birthday night choice, best dj music-night out choice. Hands-down THE BEST CHOICE. We tried the Whole Fish, NY steak, and Cheeseburger =ALL AMAZING. Prices are so reasonable, they could be charging lots and it would still be worth it!! The deep fried red snapper was so fresh and cooked perfectly moist. The steak was cooked to the perfect temp and melted in your mouth. Red beans n rice, Brussel sprouts and broccolini all cooked to perfection... The flavor of the red beans were ON POINT. We had so much much fun and the staff service was level \"above & beyond\" which is unheard of nowadays. I could go on and on but imagine this was a Thursday night. We were just looking for a cool birthday spot and can across a reel on IG. WE WILL BE BACK!! Read more I like oeste a lot! The vibes are good and they always play good music. However, the waitresses are not attentive and they are always disengaged. After waiting 29 minutes , I flagged a waitress down and asked if we could order. Our drinks took 35 minutes and came after the food. It’s always something! They bring food but no silverware so you have to wait another 5 minutes for that. The waitresses need training. This happens every time we go. Read more Really loved the whole fish. Their rice and beans is fire. Cheap but good drinks. The vibes are always great!!!  Great dinner, we had a large group and were well taken care of.  We had a good time I had the shrimp and grits. They were really good. We sat upstairs and it was a little cool. Lots of heaters . We really love this place.  The ambience was great but our server was not attentive at all so we had long waits to even order food or get another drink which is unusual for Oestes so I would still recommend the restaurant  this is what you call the old \"bait and switch\"...\n",
      "I really wanted to like this restaurant since it came highly recommended from a friend for their rooftop bar. I booked an experience for valentines day. There were 2 options listed, $50 person which included entry and credit towards food or $100 per person for the prix fixe meal. Since there was no event menu displayed, I figured we would order ala carte when we got there. We ended up ordering drinks, apps, and entrees. When the bill came, we were charged for everything we ordered, on top of the $100 I paid when making the reservation. I questioned the server about the prepaid amount and even pulled up the Opentable booking which was named \"show + main\" and the restaurant insisted the $50 was only for entry. I understand that it was a special night with live entertainment, but I feel like I was deliberately mislead. Why would anyone in their right mind choose the $50 option if $100 included food + entry? The pricing didn't make sense when I kept thinking about it on the way home. Another party seated next to us had the same situation and we both felt taken advantage of. I loved the live entertainment and I'm all for supporting local artists, especially live performances, but no one enjoys being lied to. Unfortunately due to this experience, I probably won't be back. Although I enjoyed my food. Read more Oeste catfish is off the chain. Comes out fast and fresh and amazing every time! Music was great… all around favorite thing to do on Sundays.  A huge fight broke out. Several men fighting and yelling. Had to leave. Very unsafe.  Cocktails were lovely. Service poor. The steak was overcooked and after waiting 25 minutes to have a replacement, I gave up on it. Go for the drinks and sit at the bar. Avoid the mediocre over priced food and neglectful service. \n",

      "Page 1 Comments: Read more I had a reservation at 7:45 but our table wasn’t ready till about 8:15… this would be unfortunate however, they had an intimate little waiting area. We ordered drinks and they ended up comping them to make up for the wait, this was a very kind gesture. We didn’t mind waiting at all. Once our table was ready, we were sat at a great table in the dining area and enjoyed our food. The deviled eggs were delicious and the chicken liver came w a Serrano plum jam that added such a unique twist to the liver. The summer schnitzel was extraordinary and the array of sautéed veggies on top made it a pleasure to eat bite after bite. Great experience. Great food. Great light fixtures! Read more Caeser salad was unique and delicious. Tuna presentation needs work. Service great.  We were disappointed first because of the noise level.  We could not carry a conversation without shouting although we asked to be moved upstairs.

      "My husband sent his Cosmopolitan cocktail back for it was so bitter, it was undrinkable.  The starters are good and affordable. We liked the deviled eggs and the chicken mousse, but not the burnt toasts which came with it.  The entrée menu is very short and the only red meat was a rib eye at $60.00!  Both of our entrees (rib eye and seared tuna) had very spicy accompaniments which we did not expect and were not mentioned on the menu.  We skipped desserts.  The service was not great.  First our server had to kneel down near us in order to hear us and us, him.  He was far too busy and that affected the quality of service.  He handled the whole upstairs room alone. I think he did his best under the circumstances.  We definitely will not come back.  However if you can handle that level of noise (some call it a good \"ambiance\"), and spend less by choosing a couple of starters instead of an entree, it might work!? Read more A beautiful restaurant with a very attentive staff. We tried the tasting menu I and were very happy with the sale toons from the chef. We did miss a few of their signature dishes but we will back for those and the rest of the drink menu.  Excellent! Ambiance is great and the place has a wonderful vibe. The staff is top notch. Very attentive, knowledgeable and professional without being stuffy. The food was outstanding from cocktails, appetizers, main course to dessert and finishing with a delicious aperitif.  Very fine indeed!  We had a great time! Good food, very good cocktails, and very good ambience and service. We enjoyed it very much, perfect date night spot.  Great food and experience with Jacob as our waiter. While seemingly simple the Cauliflower steak was amazingly flavorful. Very nice atmosphere.  Excellent meal! Attentive and timely service. Ambiance was wonderful. We had a very enjoyable time and will continue to be returning customers!  Loved this place! Such great ambiance!, good cocktails, good food. Hubby & I enjoyed celebrating our anniversary there  Such a fun experience. Loved the live jazz downstairs. We enjoyed the tasting menu, but a few of the dishes were lacking a bit in depth and creativity. The steak was fantastic, and was the star of the show. The summer salad was disappointing, as the lettuces were not as crisp and as fresh as they should be. Dessert was a 10/10! Service was attentive and friendly. \n",

Highly recommend booking for a group or a date night!  Great service and good variety among entrees and starters.  Well executed.  Always a creative and varied cocktail menu.  Food was fair but very ordinary/boring. Wine selection very limited.  This is literally my favorite place to be in Oakland!! After moving here from Chicago, I’ve been so thrilled to find a place with some of the most amazing food I’ve ever eaten, the sexiest ambiance and amazing service 🤗  This is a wonderful neighborhood gem. The service was great, and although the menu is somewhat limited, things were very tasty. The ambience was warm. \n"
