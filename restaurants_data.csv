Food was outstanding as was the friendly attentive service.  EXCELLENT! The we basically asked them to give us whatever was in the pictures online haha. It’s was delicious!  Great food.  Hit all the public recommendations of garlic noodles and xiao long bao.

Add in steamed sea bass in fish sauce and sliced cucumbers.  This was our favorite ahead of the xiao long bao.

Finished with chicken coconut curry and jasmine rice. Read more I picked China LIve without really knowing much about it.  Was delighted to find out that the chef behind it was the chef that opened Bettlenut in the 90s.  The food was outstanding.  We over ordered because everything sounded so good.  The Hong Kong noodles and the Spicy Tofu were highlights.  The Oolong Milk Tea was a revelation.  We had an early res because we were heading to a show down the street, and I could tell that it would get loud and crowded later in the evening.  The one suggestion I have is to put sliders on the chairs - they make too much noise on the concrete floor. Read more Superbe restaurant ! Très bons plats et de l espace pour les grandes tablées . Super accueil, je recommande !  While the food is ok but not great and the place has overall nice seating, the service was horrible since it took a while to even get the attention of the waiter, then we were told that overall portion sizes are small and encouraged to order more food...which we did and then it turned out we ended up with way too much food !.  The timing of how the food was served appeared off (curry shows up with no rice which came much later) and the noise levels are very high.  Finally the mandatory 20% tip and other charges are just way too high.  We will not return Read more What great food and service! Everything we had was delicious and well-prepared.  Delicious and fun dining experience.

Our mezzanine dining room features a rotating menu of fresh, seasonal supper-fare with local and sustainably sourced meats, fish and produce.

Tuna presentation needs work. Service great.  We were disappointed first because of the noise level.  We could not carry a conversation without shouting although we asked to be moved upstairs.  When we left and walked through downstairs, the room was packed and noisy, and 2 people were eating their meal on TV trays! 
My husband sent his Cosmopolitan cocktail back for it was so bitter, it was undrinkable.  The starters are good and affordable. We liked the deviled eggs and the chicken mousse, but not the burnt toasts which came with it.  The entrée menu is very short and the only red meat was a rib eye at $60.00!  Both of our entrees (rib eye and seared tuna) had very spicy accompaniments which we did not expect and were not mentioned on the menu.  We skipped desserts.  The service was not great.  First our server had to kneel down near us in order to hear us and us, him.  He was far too busy and that affected the quality of service.  He handled the whole upstairs room alone. I think he did his best under the circumstances.  We definitely will not come back.  However if you can handle that level of noise (some call it a good ""ambiance""), and spend less by choosing a couple of starters instead of an entree, it might work!? Read more A beautiful restaurant with a very attentive staff. We tried the tasting menu I and were very happy with the sale toons from the chef. We did miss a few of their signature dishes but we will back for those and the rest of the drink menu.  We had a great time! Good food, very good cocktails, and very good ambience and service. We enjoyed it very much, perfect date night spot.  Excellent! Ambiance is great and the place has a wonderful vibe. The staff is top notch. Very attentive, knowledgeable and professional without being stuffy. The food was outstanding from cocktails, appetizers, main course to dessert and finishing with a delicious aperitif.  Very fine indeed!  Great food and experience with Jacob as our waiter. While seemingly simple the Cauliflower steak was amazingly flavorful. Very nice atmosphere.  Excellent meal! Attentive and timely service. Ambiance was wonderful. We had a very enjoyable time and will continue to be returning customers!  Loved this place! Such great ambiance!, good cocktails, good food. Hubby & I enjoyed celebrating our anniversary there  Such a fun experience. Loved the live jazz downstairs. We enjoyed the tasting menu, but a few of the dishes were lacking a bit in depth and creativity. The steak was fantastic, and was the star of the show. The summer salad was disappointing, as the lettuces were not as crisp and as fresh as they should be. Dessert was a 10/10! Service was attentive and friendly.  My favorite dining experience in Oakland ever. The drinks, the service, the food, the ambiance were all off the charts. I will be back often.

Pay close attention when paying check. Tip is pre added and I ended up tipping generously to a server who had horrible service.  The food was great. The meat selections were exquisite and the atmosphere was very fun. Not your typical steak house where it’s dark and very silent, this was the complete opposite.
Our server AJ was -amazing. He explained in detail the entire menu and recommended two of his favorite dishes and we ordered one (the sea bass) which was 10/10.
He also asked what we were celebrating and we mentioned my brothers birthday. He then surprised us with a whole entire tray of desserts, with my brothers name written on the wood board! We were NOT expecting this at all. I have never been to a restaurant where they give us 4 desserts at once “on the house”.
It was a pleasant surprise and it was very appreciated.
Thank you AJ for showing us what great service should be. Read more The food was delicious with quality you can taste! The service was also spot on. If there’s any complaints, then the parking situation has to be the worst. Because there is no valet or parking structures nearby, you have to search for parking on the street. Getting dropped off is definitely a better option. I also suggest a better menu presentation, get rid of the disposable paper menus. Thank you for the great dinner experience. Cheers! Read more Service was terrible honestly. Food was mediocre and over priced. I paid $20 for asparagus only to not eat them because they were severely overcooked and mushy. I ordered the surf and turf and could tell the lobster was just sitting however the steak was piping hot. All in all, spent $450+ when I definitely would’ve had a better experience at Chili’s. I would go back for drinks or after a bar but probably not to dine in again. Read more Nearby parking is challenging to find at beat.  Way too loud for a business dinner.  Asked to be in a quiet corner and was placed in the middle of the restaurant.   Service was good but food was subpar.  Sea bass entree was really an appetizer.  Steak entrees were way below advertised weight.   $700+ for 4 persons is ludicrous.  Amazing experience thanks to AJ.. highly recommend asking for him.. extremely knowledgeable of the menu as well as fast prompt service.. would not go without asking for him personally.. thanks again  We had a great experience at STK. Our server, AJ, was so helpful and was so attentive. Thank you AJ for such a great experience  Restaurant was nice inside. A little dirty though: for example, the booth we sat in had crumbs and a large piece of food on floor near our table. The food was good. We started with sliders and tuna tartare which were both spectacular. I also love their bread with the blue cheese butter drizzled on it. For our entrees we both got steaks, which were good but not great. The quality of the meat seemed less than compared to local steakhouses in the area such as Epic or Harris. Our server was kind and did a great job. Be forewarned, their bar closes earlier than the restaurant. You will want to be sure you order any drinks before hand. We couldn’t get drinks with our dessert because the bartenders were closed and ready to go home. This was shortly after 11:30pm on a Thurs. The restaurant closes at 11pm but we were not given a last call notice. The restaurant seems to cater more to tourists than locals. But we were glad that they are an option for a late night sit down dinner in the city. We may go back if we ever want to eat dinner after a show or something like that. Read more Cocktails were not great, service was good and food was ok, bit overpriced.  Service was a little off. Our waitress took my menu away from me before I even ordered. They didn’t have ice tea and they said they ran out (who runs out of ice tea at 11:45 am?).  I ordered the burger special but lettuce wrapped. When I got it, it didn’t have the sauce that the ones with buns had. I had to ask for it by flagging our waitress down as she didn’t come back to ask if we needed anything else.
 The burger was good though, as well as the fries. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/48569639.webp

The food was Delicious and Doug E Fresh was FABULOUS!!  The atmosphere was nice and energetic. We were greeted with a smile, and we're taken care of right away.  Our server
Seem to be more task driven than customer driven.  He would ask a question, but then would be walking away while we were giving the answer.  He came to our table 4 different times within a half-hour span, asking if we wanted another drink.

Our calamari came out cold, which we did not understand since it was our first item received.  The spinach salad was very good. The shrimp and scallop fritters, which used to be our favorite, have come out greasy and lacking flavor for our last 2 visits. All we can taste is onions.  No shrimp or scallop flavors or
Or seasoning.

Though the entertainment was exceptional, we probably will not be returning for the food. Read more Great food. Great Service. Dougie Fresh concert was great!

Located in Oakland’s historic Grand Lake District, Bardo is a neighborhood lounge and restaurant inspired by the comfort and camaraderie of a mid-century dinner party. Drawing on the celebration and elegance of old school entertaining, we envisioned a space for friends and neighbors to enjoy amazing food, cocktails, conversation and great music.

Our lounge is a swank living room, furnished with hand-picked finds from antique and vintage markets from Palm Springs to Portland. Our mezzanine dining room features a rotating menu of fresh, seasonal supper-fare with local and sustainably sourced meats, fish and produce. While we think the food, drinks and atmosphere are all great reasons to visit us, it’s the relationships with our friends, neighbors and guests that is the driving force behind Bardo.","Read more Caeser salad was unique and delicious. Tuna presentation needs work. Service great.  We were disappointed first because of the noise level.  We could not carry a conversation without shouting although we asked to be moved upstairs.  When we left and walked through downstairs, the room was packed and noisy, and 2 people were eating their meal on TV trays! 
My husband sent his Cosmopolitan cocktail back for it was so bitter, it was undrinkable.  The starters are good and affordable. We liked the deviled eggs and the chicken mousse, but not the burnt toasts which came with it.  The entrée menu is very short and the only red meat was a rib eye at $60.00!  Both of our entrees (rib eye and seared tuna) had very spicy accompaniments which we did not expect and were not mentioned on the menu.  We skipped desserts.  The service was not great.  First our server had to kneel down near us in order to hear us and us, him.  He was far too busy and that affected the quality of service.  He handled the whole upstairs room alone. I think he did his best under the circumstances.  We definitely will not come back.  However if you can handle that level of noise (some call it a good ""ambiance""), and spend less by choosing a couple of starters instead of an entree, it might work!? Read more A beautiful restaurant with a very attentive staff. We tried the tasting menu I and were very happy with the sale toons from the chef. We did miss a few of their signature dishes but we will back for those and the rest of the drink menu.  Excellent! Ambiance is great and the place has a wonderful vibe. The staff is top notch. Very attentive, knowledgeable and professional without being stuffy. The food was outstanding from cocktails, appetizers, main course to dessert and finishing with a delicious aperitif.  Very fine indeed!  We had a great time! Good food, very good cocktails, and very good ambience and service. We enjoyed it very much, perfect date night spot.  Great food and experience with Jacob as our waiter. While seemingly simple the Cauliflower steak was amazingly flavorful. Very nice atmosphere.  Excellent meal! Attentive and timely service. Ambiance was wonderful. We had a very enjoyable time and will continue to be returning customers!  Loved this place! Such great ambiance!, good cocktails, good food. Hubby & I enjoyed celebrating our anniversary there  Such a fun experience. Loved the live jazz downstairs. We enjoyed the tasting menu, but a few of the dishes were lacking a bit in depth and creativity. The steak was fantastic, and was the star of the show. The summer salad was disappointing, as the lettuces were not as crisp and as fresh as they should be. Dessert was a 10/10! Service was attentive and friendly.

Pay close attention when paying check. Tip is pre added and I ended up tipping generously to a server who had horrible service.  The food was great. The meat selections were exquisite and the atmosphere was very fun. Not your typical steak house where it’s dark and very silent, this was the complete opposite.
Our server AJ was -amazing. He explained in detail the entire menu and recommended two of his favorite dishes and we ordered one (the sea bass) which was 10/10.
He also asked what we were celebrating and we mentioned my brothers birthday. He then surprised us with a whole entire tray of desserts, with my brothers name written on the wood board! We were NOT expecting this at all. I have never been to a restaurant where they give us 4 desserts at once “on the house”.
It was a pleasant surprise and it was very appreciated.
Thank you AJ for showing us what great service should be. Read more The food was delicious with quality you can taste! The service was also spot on. If there’s any complaints, then the parking situation has to be the worst. Because there is no valet or parking structures nearby, you have to search for parking on the street. Getting dropped off is definitely a better option. I also suggest a better menu presentation, get rid of the disposable paper menus. Thank you for the great dinner experience. Cheers! Read more Service was terrible honestly. Food was mediocre and over priced. I paid $20 for asparagus only to not eat them because they were severely overcooked and mushy. I ordered the surf and turf and could tell the lobster was just sitting however the steak was piping hot. All in all, spent $450+ when I definitely would’ve had a better experience at Chili’s. I would go back for drinks or after a bar but probably not to dine in again. Read more Nearby parking is challenging to find at beat.  Way too loud for a business dinner.  Asked to be in a quiet corner and was placed in the middle of the restaurant.   Service was good but food was subpar.  Sea bass entree was really an appetizer.  Steak entrees were way below advertised weight.   $700+ for 4 persons is ludicrous.  Amazing experience thanks to AJ.. highly recommend asking for him.. extremely knowledgeable of the menu as well as fast prompt service.. would not go without asking for him personally.. thanks again  We had a great experience at STK. Our server, AJ, was so helpful and was so attentive. Thank you AJ for such a great experience  Restaurant was nice inside. A little dirty though: for example, the booth we sat in had crumbs and a large piece of food on floor near our table. The food was good. We started with sliders and tuna tartare which were both spectacular. I also love their bread with the blue cheese butter drizzled on it. For our entrees we both got steaks, which were good but not great. The quality of the meat seemed less than compared to local steakhouses in the area such as Epic or Harris. Our server was kind and did a great job. Be forewarned, their bar closes earlier than the restaurant. You will want to be sure you order any drinks before hand. We couldn’t get drinks with our dessert because the bartenders were closed and ready to go home. This was shortly after 11:30pm on a Thurs. The restaurant closes at 11pm but we were not given a last call notice. The restaurant seems to cater more to tourists than locals. But we were glad that they are an option for a late night sit down dinner in the city. We may go back if we ever want to eat dinner after a show or something like that. Read more Cocktails were not great, service was good and food was ok, bit overpriced.  Service was a little off. Our waitress took my menu away from me before I even ordered. They didn’t have ice tea and they said they ran out (who runs out of ice tea at 11:45 am?).  I ordered the burger special but lettuce wrapped. When I got it, it didn’t have the sauce that the ones with buns had. I had to ask for it by flagging our waitress down as she didn’t come back to ask if we needed anything else.

Unfortunately, It was not seasoned. I had others taste it and they said the same…not just under seasoned, but there appeared to be no seasoning on it at all.  I would assume that it was not marinated.

The service and ambiance was great, but my meal - as well as the other dishes ordered by my family were quite underwhelming.

Though my food was cold and rice was a little mushy it stil taste great. Everyone else food was delicious. I will be back and I definitely recommend it.  My guy likes the rooftop experience, so when I heard Oeste has rooftop dining, I booked it.  This is a very lively place with a DJ inside on the first floor and rooftop dining enjoys music through speakers. On the loud side, but if you're young it's a great vibe. The food didn't wow me but it was fine. The waitress was busy yet super nice. It's a fun and social atmosphere.  Amazing! Will be back. Love the menu selections. Good morning ☀️ excited to come back and try something new!  Fantastic ambiance, very slow to be seated but server was wonderful, the food was terrible and disappointing. The food was all very very salt forward. We ate the wings, Korean inspired brussels, ceviche, and ceasar salad. The salad was the only truly edible thing. The brussles were very salty and the korean inspired sauce was not anything I would put the word korean on (and I am Korean). The wings were very basic and were spicy without much flavor, aside from the spice and salt. And the ceviche was in a red sauce... Again the space was great. We sat upstairs on the outdoor patio (which is not accessible to wheelchair users from what I could see) and aside from waiting for 5 minutes at the host desk to be acknowledged by anyone including one person I later learned was likely an owner, the service from our waitstaff was timely.

After speaking to several friends and folks in the community I learned that Oeste Bar & Cafe is a place where folks go to after they've eaten. That said, the drinks on the menu all seemed very sweet... perhaps to balance out the food... I am a whiskey drinker and there was a decent selection of bourbon. My partner enjoys wine and in speaking with the server learned that the house wine and bubbly were all sweet, nothing dry. She went with a bottle of Oyster Bay which is a terribly sad option for date night... 

I was so excited to go to Oeste because of all the hype out there but don't know that I'll be back unless there's an after dinner party or even that draws my attention.

By the time I would get to the front of the line, I probably would’ve missed my reservation.

The Nikkei Cebiche was phenomenal, fresh ahi, and the leche de tigre sauce/marinade was bright fresh, and flavorful.  We had a special black cod dish that was the star of our dinner, and the Seco La Mar which was excellent. Everything was cooked to perfection, great layers and contrasts of flavors and textures.

It was the perfect consistency, and dense enough to share, delicious, the strawberry freshness was perfect to cut through the more dense cake and tres leches flavor.

The problem was it didn’t taste great at all. “Saucy” is a perfect name because the only flavor was in each sauce. We ordered popcorn shrimp which was overcooked and totally bland. The dipping sauce was basic. Chicken wings were very crispy and smothered in sauce. Sauce was too sweet and beyond the skin the chicken meat had no flavor. Garlic noodles were basic. Veggie dish was super basic and only flavor came from the thin (again sweet) sauce at the bottom of the bowl. None of the flavors were complex. Just super sweet and basic.

Delivered by the attentive service staff and sommeliers, the cuisine of Commis showcases some of the best Northern California ingredients that are in season through modern and classic cooking techniques. The cuisine aims to bridge the flavors, textures and temperatures of the East and West with every course with the intention to excite and satisfy.","Read more Puzzling that this place is so highly touted.  Have eaten here twice now, was very disappointed both times.  The dishes just didn't work.  Strange combinations that were discordant.  We have eaten at many Michelin starred restaurants, can't understand how Commis gets even one star.  I would describe the service as too self-conscious -- trying to be a certain way that they think they should be, but instead of looking natural, it looks like an act.  They were certainly pleasant and attentive, but it all felt awkward.  Not going back. Read more Excellent food. Chef continues to elevate his cooking! Commis deserves three Michelin stars!  elegant dining experience good for special occasions. wine pairing spot on.
all dishes delicious, 10 course set menu, and wonderfully presented
waitstaff all wearing suits with ties and very attentive  Awesome food and wonderful service.  Pricey though.  Incredible experience. The chef's creativity and the team's execution were on full display with every course and we'll definitely be back for more.  We have experienced several tasting menus over the years and this one was among the best. The menu was pescatarian forward thus the wine pairing (which I highly recommend) centered on whites. I don’t particularly care for white wines,however, the sommelier at Commis is clearly a genius. We had a Sake, a Chenin Blanc and a very light Madeira that paired wonderfully with our meal. The oyster parfait and slow poached egg yolk with smoked dates, alliums & malt were my favorites. The staff were attentive but not obtrusive, knowledgeable and gracious. Obviously not something we can do all the time but definitely recommend for special occasions. Read more When we sat down we were told about a wagyu upgrade. At some point I asked about it. I was told it would be part of the presentation. It was never offered to us.
The meal is very heavy on fish (raw and cooked) and white wines. If you prefer more meat and red wine this isn’t the place for you.
I made a mistake at one point about what was on the plate and the waiter snickered. Nobody should snicker when you’re spending over $1000 for two people. Read more We had an amazing experience for a special evening. The food was delicious, the staff were knowledgeable and attentive. I was a little surprised when we were told that the courses would be revealed as they brought them out, and yet it worked. The flavors, textures and ingenuity of the dishes were superb. We did get the full course menu and wine pairing to bring home.  From start to finish, the experience was astonishing, almost overwhelming (in the very best way). Even the ingredients that I thought I ""knew"" were transformed. If you are a cook (even simply a home cook), when dining out you often ask yourself if you could make dishes at home. At Commis the answer for me was a resounding no. That answer — and the fact that the food is so delicious, so surprising, and yet (once experienced) seems almost inevitable — proved that making this reservation was absolutely the right choice. (I have always wanted to eat here, and it was a really good call.) I'll be thinking about these dishes every day until the next time I've saved up enough to return. Read more Exceptional experience.

A large selection of wines, cocktails and beers make MUA a great spot for an evening out with friends.

Family owned and run Mua was one of the first restaurants to open in what was then Auto Row in Oakland, in 2008. After their first 2 restaurants, Pastoral in Berkeley (first opened in 1982 while still students, 37 in the architecture program at Cal and San-Ju painting at SFAI) then later Soizic (Jack London Square, 1996), they wanted to shift gears from heavily curated menus to more comfort-based fare catering more to the eclectic and artistic community in Oakland. Today you’ll find people of all ages and backgrounds, from Too Short to Jerry Brown.","Read more Happy to see Mua survive the pandemic years. They have a lively and energetic vibe, lots of great music, and tasty food and drinks. Encourage folks to check them out.  My husband and I got a night out without our toddler! I knew Mua as an Oakland staple and after reading more and a menu once over, seemed like the perfect date night spot.

Did not disappoint! The vibe was fun! Romantic, soft lighting, almost dark. Live DJ spinning on the atrium second level. Service was friendly and attentive from beginning to end. Cocktails were fun and fresh! We shared plates and enjoyed everything. Well spiced and seasoned, each dish packed unique flavor. The real highlight though were the pork spare ribs...

The meat was fall off the bone tender but had a nice charred crisp you still had to cut through. The sauce had a mole quality. It was thick, heavily savory spiced but sweet and bright with cinnamon and herbs. Left a comforting coat in your mouth. I'd love to know for how long and how low they cook these for! Absolutely yum!

We will absolutely be back for more ribs and other delights! Thanks to all at Mua for a lovely evening in Oakland! Read more The servers and the DJ. Absolutely amazing appetizers  Staff seemed a little “stuffy”. Our waiter was not friendly and the hostess wasn’t either. But we had a good time regardless. The food was great.  This is a solid place to go for a good dinner before going to The Sound Room nearby.  The cavernous feel of the place is not for everyone, and the noise level can be hard for older people whose hearing is not the best.   But I would say it is a good solid place for dinner.  The Chicken Milanese is very good - be sure to try the crunchy tofu and the calimari.  MUA is an excellent choice for a great time with great food ! Justin was my server last night and he was absolutely amazing!!! Will be going back :)  Always a great experience at Mua! Great food, great service, great music - quintessential Oakland! Definitely recommend folks check it out! Glad to see the pandemic hasn’t taken away this neighborhood gem!  Wonderful food and great service and also an amazing DJ playing music.  Service is always slow and waiters are nice but not attentive. We were billed for a dish which was never brought to us. Wish they could properly train their staff and put more priority on customer service  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  Ate here before a show at the Fox, reserved a table at their 5pm opening to enjoy the dinner before walking over for 7:30 show. Perfect timing  the staff was very attentive and helpful and the food and drinks were delicious. We heard it can get noisy when busier and when a DJ is playing but we left before that happened.

Service is always top notch, menu has variety, and food is excellent.  Fantastic meal and service. A bit pricey but overall we found menu items in our price range and fully enjoyed the experience.  Food was overall good, but the quantity and price is not compatible with Alameda prices.

Biscuit - three small biscuits with butter.  Not worth the price.

Wedge Salad - good but too pricey.

Steaks were good and cooked properly.  But again proved too high.

Food always innovative, freshly delicious and wine list always interesting!  Our first visit, and we were overall very pleased. The food was very good -- appetizers we shared were the shishito peppers, halibut crudo, mushroom paté and mussels. Best mussels I've had in a long time, plump, juicy, and the broth well balanced. Generous portions here, too. Big bowl of shishitos, with a homemade mayo dip -- we asked for more. The paté richly flavored, umami, and even the one-year old loved it. The halibut was good, beautifully fresh, nicely presented, but needed a bit more salt to be great. Prices were very reasonable for the current inflated age. 

The entrees were also wonderful. We shared three, the mushroom papardelle, Cameroni -- which was big round noodles with a pork ragu, and the braised pork shoulder with spaetzle. Again, generous portions, perfectly cooked pasta that I think was all house-made. The only disappointment was the total lack of sauce or jus on the pork dish. It was dry, although very flavorful. 

We were so stuffed...but had to order one dessert for our table, the carrot cake. A huge slice, and one of the best carrot cakes I've had. 

Service was good, friendly. As the restaurant filled up, it got a little less attentive, but still OK.  I'd say my only quibble was that they didn't take flatware between the appetizer and entree plates, which made for an awkward exchange. It's a small thing, and this is not a formal restaurant, and prices are reasonable,  but it would also have been a small thing to change it out with the plates, and more gracious service. 

Overall, I'd say it's a great restaurant, with a very good menu -- lots more to explore, and we will for sure return. Read more Great restaurant. This was our first time I could not be more pleased.

The dessert was very nice as well (yogurt panna cotta), was delicious but the granola on top was too sugary and felt store bought and cheapened the experience.

The place was nice to chat in when it opened but as it got busy, the noise levels were unbearably loud (mostly loud chatter, and echo) and it definitely made us not want to linger which is the point (a reservation gives you a tight 90 minutes, which is fair)

Our server Patrick did an excellent job of not only introducing the menu, but also framing our dinner in terms of an experience to savor and remember.  He and his team on the floor were consistent in this, in addition to making my first meal here accessible and not overly “snooty,” for lack of a better term.  Although the portion sizes at first seemed small for my empty stomach, I quickly found myself unable to fit even an espresso by the dessert course, due to the richness of the cuisine.

I really want to love this place and I keep trying, but again it falls short.

Last night was the 4th time I visited my local restaurant, Grand Lake Kitchen, in the Fruitvale and I will probably be my last.

I made reservations to dine with my family for my birthday and walked away thinking - it's fine but not great.

The host at the podium wasn't welcoming and showed us several tables in the near-empty restaurant and said to 'sit anywhere'.

The food was tasty but my fries were cold and the bun on the burger was falling apart, making it a mess to eat.

The server forgot my wine order and I had to go to the bar to retrieve it myself.

The TV was one (even though no one was sitting at the bar) which changed my experience of the ambience.

The server was told it was my birthday, which was nice. They asked if I had any preference between chocolate or peanut butter and did I like desserts to be warm or cold. They brought me four doughnuts with a lit candle, which was nice. But I was expecting something chocolaty and warm... otherwise why would you even ask?

Lastly, at the end we were the last table (at 830 - the GLK closes at 9) and servers were noisily moving chairs and talking about what they were going to do after they got off work. No one noticed that we were done. We had to flagged them down to ask for our check.

It can be very noisy and I have trouble hearing, however they always accommodate to give us as quiet a table as possible (request this in advance!)  Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants to visit when we’re in the city.

Food is always great along with the phenomenal service!…you can never go wrong choosing this establishment!  Amazing service and food came out very quickly. Lasagna and soul fish were delicious. The bread could have been a little softer.  Excellent food and service!  We always love going to Original Joe's.  We arrived to this restaurant due to a recommendation of a travel seat next to us.

The recommendation was perfect!! All dishes ordered were excellent. The clam chowder soup was a very good appetizer.

As a main entree we ordered Salmon, Chicken Parmigiana and filet mignon and were simply tasty!!!

As desert, we ordered limon pie and butter cake…simply delicious!

We never cease to be amazed at how accommodating and genuinely nice ALL of the staff are from the moment we walk in the door.  Thank you for a wonderful evening.  The food was so disappointing.  We wanted to like it but alas it was just meh.  I ordered the linguine with pesto and added shrimp.  I ate all of the shrimp but took only a few bites of the linguine because it reminded me too much of Olive Garden during my frugal college days.  My husband ordered the chicken Parmesan.  Oddly enough it was topped not with mozzarella but Monterey Jack cheese???  How strangely inauthentic.  He also ordered their much hyped house made beef ravioli.  Sorry but it tasted as good as Chef Boyardee.  We left that behind too.  Service however was terrific.  Our waiter was friendly, the water was cold, wine was good, bread and butter adequate and the 7 layer chocolate cake was truly amazing.

One of our party was running late, so the servers basically ignored us until about 15 minutes after she arrived. We decided to order a variety of starters and one main to share; the main was served before even the cocktails. One reason for this was that they forgot to put the cocktail order in with the bartender. Halfway through the meal we received the cocktails, then a few minutes after that, a second round due to some mixup. As they were walking away one member of our party said the'd be willing to drink the second round too, but before we could stop them the drinks had been dumped. The rest of the food was ok, but not exceptional. The focaccia was dense and flavorless, and one dish (I forget which one) was served with an unappetizing pile of totally wilted undressed greens & herbs. Sad, because I'd like to have enjoyed those herbs with the dish but they were kinda gross. Nothing really to recommend here, sorry :( Read more Bar service was slow because they were understaffed.

She is a touring musician and eats vegetarian all over the world, for the last 16 years, and we had gone to another Bay Area veg place the night before.  She just kept saying ""this is next level"" and ""that other place was great, just like alot of good vegetarian places around the world I have been to.  But this?  I've never had such great food.

Unfortunately, wasn't very impressed. Service was slllloooowwwww - took a while for the server to take our drink order, and then took a really long time to have our plates cleared and our bill delivered. Wine was good but the cocktails didn't taste good. Apps were alright. Entrees were better but not great. Our server disappeared for about an hour and the runner had to jump in to serve our entrees and clear our table. 

Paid $30 dollars for the tiniest cheese/charcuterie board. I expected a little more variety of cheese - got a few cubes of blue cheese & provolone. Sliced apple (less than a whole), a few nuts and olives, and very few slices of prosciutto & mortadella. Not what you would expect for a charcuterie board, let's just put it that way.

Got the braised duck to share. Flavorful but a bit dry. 

Our entrees got screwed up so our table wasn't able to eat at the same time. After a very long wait. We were there for almost 3 hours, not by choice.

My second time visiting this establishment, the first being at the upstairs higher-end O restaurant and this time at the Bistro. Both experiences provided a very delightful meal but served with quite a bewildering service experience. Everyone we encountered in both experiences was as friendly as they could be but very much lacking in the details.

Just a few examples from my recent visit to the Bistro. Firstly, at the bar we had friendly experience with a cocktail suggested by the very lovely bartender. The drink was perfect, but was placed in front of us for a few minutes out of our reach while the bartender explained to someone behind a doorway that they were busy. After being seated by a host and no further greeting for approximately 15 minutes, our first contact with our server was being asked if we were ready to order. No water or drinks were offered until we asked. There was also some confusion with the a la carte vs. the course menus with conflicting pricing and extras. At one point we had three pieces of paper in our hands wondering what each was for. Further, the clearing of drinkware and plates were a bit ill-timed and erratic.

It was not a horrible experience. The restaurant is beautiful and seems to have a whole lot going in its favor.

Wonderful food and service - both at a high level since my first visit years ago  We dined in the outdoor parklet. As long as you don’t mind traffic, it’s fine.

The server was super accommodating and let me choose some of dishes that were brought it and overall it was a really great deal for the quality and quantity. Always order the bread and cultured butter. The food was salty but I think at Octavia it’s important to eat all the elements of the dish together. When I did that the saltiness really evened out with the other elements of the dish. The customer service and ambiance is fantastic so it’d be perfect for a date. The ingredients were
really fresh. My favorite dishes were the MISTO: perfectly fried and salted okra and ple beans with a delish dip. The MELON was probably the sweetest and juiciest melon I have ever had. I found the GARLEEK was their most complex and interesting dish. The SHELLING BEANS is their take on a chili and could have been a home run had it come with some of the fixings I usually expect with chili. The TROUT was cooked to perfection but again lacking some fresh ingredient that would really make it dance on the taste buds. Overall I had a good culinary experience and excited to see how this restaurant evolves. Read more Food was flavorful but not particularly interesting. Halibut was cooked well, the stone fruits stoned and grilled fine, the corn lasagna corny and supple. But the lasagna was just luke warm and the frito misto way too salty.

Also they served the cake with tiny cheap plastic forks.  Ambience was quiet and serene it was not a busy time when we went. Food was fresh and tasty.  I believe the prices went up since COVID/inflation. My only feedback would be  to consider increasing your portion sizes as well if prices are rising.  Toda la comida estuvo deliciosa pero nos estaban apurando para cerrar apesar que eran las 9pm y cierran a las 10pm  Fantastic restaurant for a family birthday celebration. The chefs put on a great show and the servers are very courteous and attentive. Highly recommended. ",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/4/62515928.webp

We enjoyed a gin cocktail and a beer.  Then ordered a steak and a salad with shrimp.    All very good.  Enjoyed the eclectic music, not too loud. Also took the chocolate dessert home.  It was about $60pp.  Glad to try this new Cooperage location.  They have a nice private room that can seat 35 people. Read more Perfect lunch.  Perfectly shaved and cooked Brussel sprouts.  Followed by a perfect burger and onion rings. And a Nicoise Salad.  Perfect.
All complimented by perfect, friendly superior service!  My dining companion's food was excellent and mine was pretty good.  My entree was sitting in a pool of liquid (water/grease/a combination of the two?).  It was the same great-tasting eggplant parmesan I have at Cooperage before in Lafayette.  I did drain off this liquid before eating it.  It was lukewarm with some parts of it actually cold as if it had been hastily microwaved before serving it.

Mostly I felt some of the service needed some polishing up.  Two very pleasant men waited on us. 
I received a beet salad on a large rectangular platter but no utensil to scoop it on to another plate and no other plates for this but the small bread plates already on the table.  The salad platter and small plates we used to eat it were not promptly removed when we were done with them.   There was no salt and pepper on the table and I noticed none on the other tables.  If the restaurant does this for a reason I would be curious to know about it.  Generally, I like to have the option of adding this  at times.

As I said, the staff was very nice all around but some of these details would make for a better experience.

Thanks Read more Excellent food & drinks, plus a fun atmosphere. We’re quickly moving it from “somewhere to try” to “regular haunt”  One of our favorite spots to eat in Walnutcreek. We come here probably 3 or 4 times a month. Kid and dog friendly. Good selection of food and always yummy. I’d say the best hamburger in WC!  Great good; fabulous service; it was a little loud and difficult to have a conversation within our party of 7 people.  Perfect in every respect, from seating through leaving. Enjoyed conversation over lunch for nearly 3 hours without any pressure to complete our meal.  We had a great experience, the service was excellent and the food was very good.  Went here to celebrate an accomplishment by one of our family members. This was a Sunday for dinner. The restaurant was quite empty, but food service was a very slow regardless. We ordered three filet mignon steaks and a fish and they came out very slow. The cook on the fillets was good/as requested, and the cook on the Seabass was very delicious. However, the spinach that came with the Seabass had way too much garlic. We saw another table of two be seated at the same time as us get served their food and plates cleared before we got our main dishes. Additionally one of us was more hungry and we ordered a fourth steak, and we ordered it medium, but it was delivered to us rare. We returned it and asked for it to be cooked a little longer and it took about 15 to 20 minutes for it to come back and then it was cooked well done. For as much money we paid for all the steaks, this was very bad service, especially in the kitchen.￼ I find the cooking in the kitchen and the mistakes that occur in their often drive bad experiences at restaurants. The host/manager did try to repair the situation, but we were not interested in a free dessert to compensate for the poorly cooked steak. This restaurant really needs to get its service levels better because it is so slow and I read those reviews from other people that ate there previously. Not sure if I’ll come again due to the mediocre food and the slow food service. Sad because this location is a great location for restaurants if someone can get the service right. ￼ Read more We made last minute reservations, so we had to sit in the bar area. The service isn’t as good there. Are serving (Javier) was great, but seemed overwhelmed by all the tables he was expected to service. The food was good, but my seabass was a bit undercooked.

Such a fun place to go with friends.  Ramen was good,  but nothing amazing. I've had just as good Ramen for less nearby. The Loco moco was not good. Came out in a beautiful presentation, then was mashed up all together and not appetizing at all. Apps were good, restaurant is adorable. Spent over 100$. Wouldn't come again.  Great service and my kids loved it. Thank you 😁😁😁😁  Never a big fan of ramen. Always been told that I’ve never had a good ramen place to go to. Decided to give it one more shot & so happy I did!

Overall it was a great dining experience  My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time here celebrating his birthday. We were offered a comped glass of champagne since we were celebrating. The place definitely gives swanky steakhouse but with a more modern twist. I HIGHLY recommend the Pavé Tots with caviar, the steak tartare, the potato puree and the truffle bordelais sauce. You really can’t go wrong with any steak you choose. If you’re a cutlery or a knife nerd, they let you choose your own steak knife from their eclectic collection of hand made knives.

It was our 15 year anniversary, so we were looking for something really special and they did not disappoint.  The service was very attentive, they both congratulated us and brought us some extras to celebrate our anniversary, as well as giving detailed explanations of each dish, the background of the fish and how they prepared it.  

The food itself was, across the board spectacular.  I ran out of superlatives to use but the food was clearly well thought out, it was subtle but clearly was composed and each piece of sashimi had a point of view and a taste/feeling that they were trying to convey.

Excelente experiencia! Muy buena cálidad y el mejor servicio  Everything about the experience was amazing; the quality of the food and hospitality were outstanding. unfortunately, we were seated next to a group of walk-ins who treated the experience like it was a regular Denny's diner-style restaurant. Loud making Facetime calls, rude toward the culture. I felt they were disrespectful to the experience, making the feel of everything lower quality for the price we were paying. I know I had to reserve the (table) but was seated at the bar way in advance and prepared for it by dressing accordingly but these walk-in guests did not have the same respect for the restaurant. I hope by writing this the restaurant will understand allowing walk-in guests is probably not the best look for guests that are preparing and acknowledging the preparation that goes into eating at a restaurant of this caliber. Read more Sato Omakase has become the gold standard place to take friends or work colleagues for an excellent dinner. The quality of the food is excellent but the service is really the star here.

But on an empty Wednesday night, service was a bit awkward (even though they were super nice).

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and exceptional service. The staff went above and beyond to make our night memorable, even surprising us with a complimentary glass of champagne to toast our milestone.

The menu was an exquisite blend of flavors and creativity. We started with the fresh oysters, which were simply divine. For the main course, I opted for the seared scallops, and my wife had the filet mignon. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. The flavors were so well-balanced, it was clear that each ingredient was chosen with care and precision.

To top off the evening, we indulged in the decadent chocolate soufflé, which was the perfect ending to a flawless meal. The attention to detail, from the plating to the impeccable service, truly made our anniversary dinner one to remember.

Brought my father in-law here for his birthday at brunch. I absolutely love Foreign Cinema and have been many times for brunch and dinner. We really enjoyed our food for the most part, but the service was quite bad. She never asked if we wanted another drink. When my husband asked for a second Coke, the second one is flat. When we alerted the server, she put sparkling water in it. She never checked in to see if we wanted additional beverages, despite all of us being done with our wine and cocktails.

We were celebrating a big birthday for my sister and my son's engagement.

Our server was friendly and helpful, food was just OK, we didn't really like the wines she recommended but they weren't bad. However, what was just utterly unacceptable is that our server recommended a white wine and when they brought it to the table it was at room temperature ie had never been chilled. So it sat in a bucket of ice for 30 mins meanwhile we had to eat the food we ordered without the wine she had suggested we pair with it. And then when I ordered champagne to toast the newly engaged couple, AGAIN, it was not chilled. How can you possibly recommend champagne, charge 100-200 dollars/bottle and not even have it chilled to the correct serving temperature. Ruined the whole evening and I am never going back.

The entrees of scallops and salmon were beautifully plated and among the best we have had in any previous restaurant, and we have been in some of the best.  The apple & greens salad was plentiful with lovely textures and tastes.  Service was extremely attentive but not intrusive.  We felt welcomed.  Cocktails were well made.

We fortunately were seated on a banquette on the back side of the dining room, as upon entering the restaurant the volume of music was much too high.  It was minimized due to our location.

The staff are all nicely dressed and friendly. We will definitely come back! It is certainly a must place to dine if you're visiting Mountain View! Read more If you’re looking for a decent meal close to the Shoreline Amphitheater, then this restaurant could work. Comments I read about it being expensive were spot on. Lamb Chops $48, Halibut $47, Black truffle shavings $35, Venti Manhattan $38, glasses of wine ~$28+. Then when we went to pay for two people, they have already added the tip. Is that common for Mountain View restaurants or just this restaurant?  It’s common for South Beach, but in this area?

Beyond the price, atmosphere is pretty nice, space between tables is generous, food is served at the right temperatures and portions are proper - not too big nor small.

Would we go back? It’s a toss up. But again the short distance to Shoreline is definitely a plus. And there is parking across the street for free after 5 so you could walk to the venue instead of driving if desired and a Tesla charger across the street also a plus. Read more This is our go-to restaurant for all special occasions in our family.  We’ve yet had a bad meal or poor service over the years.  The service is excellent always.

The food is fresh & well prepared and very consistent.  We’ll be back for the next BD’s, anniversary, family get-together, etc… Read more Rated experience high but the meal was extremely expensive and portions were small.  Cocktail ($24-28)and mocktails ($16) prices are by far the highest I have seen ANYWHERE!

Lastly, 20% tip added to any size party….AND TAX charged for the tip.  Restaurant is calculating tax incorrectly and making extra money on each table.  When items are so expensive, the overcharge adds up quickly for extra revenue for the restaurant.  They really need to correct this!  Combine the tax issue, automatic gratuity and outrageous prices and you can’t help but feel taken advantage of.   I will attach support pictures if I am able. Read more Amazing experience!

The halibut filet, fettuccine with duck confit, calamari, and sizzling prawns were all very great options. The experience was 5/5 with the minor exceptions that our water glasses were not filled as often as we would’ve liked, we were told to keep our used silverware instead of wait staff replacing them, and an automatic 20% gratuity was added when presented the bill. Didn’t California just pass a transparency law where auto gratuity was banned? If we are dropping $350 for 2, the expectation should be for wait staff to anticipate our needs without asking. Coming from someone with years of fine dining experience at an award winning restaurant establishment… Read more Our first time back in a couple of years and things have slipped a bit.  2 of 3 items that we had could have been better - calamari appetizer was overcooked and the fettucini duck confit wasn't great.  Service as always was exemplary.  One new wrinkle that I found irritating was the gratuity was included.  This fact was very clearly indicated on the bill but the actual math portion was unclear as the tip and total were listed along with a line for additional tip - I suspect some diners will be double tipping as the natural tendency is to sum the numbers.

For desert, we had the chocolate pie which was delicious.

However the service was subpar and disappointing. The hostess who greeted us, while nice and friendly, ran ahead of us and expected us to run after her to our table without checking if we were even behind her. Hard for ladies in high heels to do. I had to double check where our table was as she just waved us in its general direction.
Our main server, while again being a nice man, didn’t understand some of our requests very well. He tried to take several dishes away (and a glass of wine) while we were still eating/drinking and we had to stop him - this happened three times. When he brought our dishes he didn’t remember who ordered what and just haphazardly tossed everything on the table. He got a wine order completely wrong. He didn’t space out the dishes well so items were coming out while we were still eating previous courses so everything felt rushed. So either this server was very badly trained or he’s not very good at his job but we come to a restaurant like this and pay the prices that we do for a well rounded experience and we didn’t receive that.

The food is delicious, the staff is super professional and helpful, and the location and views are fabulous. I will be definitely coming back many times.  Service and ambiance were very nice. The food was not up to our expectations- not bad, but not amazing.  In celebration of her 65th birthday, I took a dear friend to lunch at Sula.  

We shared a starter, burrata with tomato jam, and both ordered fish and chips. The food was very tasty, and the service was very good.  

My only suggestion to the restaurant is to reconsider the presentation of the fish and chips.  
They were served in a large wire basket on a too-small plate.  The apple slaw, aioli, ketchup, and malt vinegar were in small stainless steel timbale cups that held maybe 2-3 tablespoons each.  They made sense for the dipping sauces but not for the apple slaw.   The plate was too small for the basket and the timbales.  The fish and chips were difficult to eat, and by the time we ate enough of the fish to get to the French fries, they were cold.  

All in all, our lunch was enjoyable.  Of what I saw being served to the other diners around us, their plates looked really good too.

When I shared my disappointment, she could care less and did nothing to help the situation. The waiter was curt and rude. Once we got our food he disappeared completely and never checked on us.

I had the ""Spanish Fried Chicken"" sandwich and it was delicious -- actually able to hold it in my hands and eat it properly; other types i've ordered at other restaurants were ridiculously piled so high you couldn't get your hands around it, much less take a bite out of it. There were scrumptious, crunchy pickles on the sandwich, really a nice touch. A glass of cava went well with that. We ordered two apps (octopus and deep-fried ""Paella"" balls, both very tasty and filling. My husband had the mussels and he loved them. Our friends' orders were both beautiful and tasty.

Read more For all its potential I found Che Fico lacking. The host and the server were cold, unsmiling, forceful and impatient. As for the meal, the suppli was a delight! The crispy shell of fried risotto cracked open to a delicate umami and hint of acidity. Also, the Insalata Triata was an elegant, yet simple salad that left me wanting more. The Cacio E Pepo spaghetti was decent, but served so early that by the time I had room on my plate to serve it, was cold. Regrettably, the Pesce, or roasted rock fish was the greatest of disappointments. As someone who relishes in saving the best for last, I was incredibly let down. The fish was quite over cooked and under seasoned. It left me with a taste that was less than palatable. In all, I would say that if you are seeking ambience over the quality of food, or you are maybe just out for a few appetizers and some wine, then by all means, go ahead and stop by. If, however, you intend to treat yourself and your date to a fine dining experience, there are many other options near by that will offer a greater level of satisfaction for your time and your hard earned money.

Glad we came back. Service was notably good. Lovely and knowledgeable server.  We had a great night catching up with old friends. The server was excellent telling us he would ""course"" our meal to make sure we were not rushed. The food was excellent as was the wine. It will be our ""go to"" place for future date nights with friends.  Food was amazing 
Service was terrible. Our server did not even care about us. I had brought a $2K bottle of wine and requested a decant and hold on the bottle and cork, instead she threw it away and not even an apology. I understand these are tough times for restaurants and people do tip well, least a person can do is be attentive to clients and keep the reputation of the restaurant Read more Our hostess server and bartender were all exceptional  Great wait staff, very upbeat and friendly. You can tell staff enjoy working there. Busy place hard to converse with fellow diners without yelling!  Absolutely delicious!!! So many amazing choices on this menu…. It was hard to choose. I must go back and try more items. Neighborhood gem and a must for anyone coming to San Francisco.  I always enjoy my experience at Delfina and last night was no different. Additionally I brought my boss and the CEO of our company. Both enjoyed the meal immensely and reminded me that we'd been before. The food is incredible and the service is impeccable. I will continue to visit when I am in town.  GINA!!!!!!!!!! Thank you so much for your warm welcome this time and every time we visit. Xoxo.  The food was terrible and the service even worse. The level of salt made the food inedible. What was worse was the service. Waitress recited an inability to address allergies. She was not friendly and we did not feel welcomed. Other people next to us commented on being unimpressed. The food was so salty you can’t even eat it let alone enjoy it. They saw we didn’t eat the food yet oh well. They don’t even serve iced tea or warm tea. Very odd restaurant. No shellfish. Pictures do not match their photos listed. Menu items do not reflect what’s on.

The ambience is fun, they play Dominican music and the service was great! I can imagine it being a lively place when it’s busy. I was actually shocked that they weren’t packed on a Saturday night.

We ordered the pernil, maduro, yellow rice, whole fried fish that comes with bacalao sauce and kidney beans. Everything was so good and cooked well. The Pernil was moist and tender, the fish was crispy but still moist inside, the maduro was crispy around the edges, perfection! The only thing we didn’t like was the sauce that came with the fish (bacalao) but that was my fault for ordering it bc we personally aren’t big fans of bacalao in general. It would be great if they offered options on what kind of sauce we want with the whole fried fish, I don’t see too many people in the west coast enjoying that sauce either.

We would 1000% come back! Probably for lunch so we can try the chimiburger. They should offer this during dinner also. I’d also like to try their seafood menu, unsure when they offer that but it wasn’t on the menu.

Like most restaurants, alaMar neglected to update their online menu with the selection and prices.  Overall, food was flavourful.  Standouts include the Camaranoes Criolla and the Fritura de Chivo.  The Dominican Slow Roasted Pork Ribs were a bit dry and the meat (inside) can use more flavour.

Margarita pizza had great crust but overly sweet tomato sauce and just a suggestion of cheese, not enough.  Watermelon cocktail lacked the sweetness of watermelon juice.  Appetizers were ok but small portions.  Only the dessert was outstanding- a chocolate mousse with delightful thin crunchy cookies and raspberry caramel. Read more Lovely environment and staff, delicious food and drinks.  The back patio is delightful - the indoor area less so, but fine. The food also was fine; heavy on bread, good, not great.

Eating next to Babette's Redwood tree, enjoying the fabulous food, the music a lovely back note to conversation, was such a joy. The service was so friendly and responsive, really the best! Loved brunch at Babette's!  The outdoor space is amazing!  the mushroom pizza was delicious! The pork belly sliders were portioned well ( so many places end up using way too much meat).  the whole crew was fantastic extremely knowledgeable and very  friendly.

The interior is well done with a mix of elegant simplicity and traditional Japanese decor.  As we walked to our table I noticed a large community table that would be great for a family celebration.

As we sat and looked at the menu my 7 yr old made a point of telling me that each table had its own outlet so she could have brought her iPad and charger with her (it had 11% left and her dad insisted there would be no where to charge it). A great detail for parents who fine white kids but also enjoy quiet those kids to be quiet lol.

Our sever came to take our order and we all realized we knew each other. He proceeded to tell us that he had been a longtime member of the team at our favorite neighborhood  sushi place. He pointed to my 16 yr old and said he  remembered when she was little and all three of us ate there. He then said until you were pregnant with her pointing to my 7 yr old. He said during Covid he started working at another sushi place in Japan town. I instantly knew it was a place I had found when I had sushi delivered for lunch at my office. He said he was so happy to see us there dining there now with the whole family.

He proceeded to tell me that this was his team there now and I smiled and waited for what was going to be
an amazing meal and it was.

We were there on a Saturday night and that might be why.  We enjoyed our meal very much, as did our guests. The room is very noisy for people with hearing aids, but being seated in the window helped a lot. Both the staff and we were confused by the $20 reservation fee from Open Table. They weren’t aware of it, and it seems a bit rude. We were advised to just call the restaurant directly next time. And hope our money will be refunded. Read more Food was good. Did not care much for the service we got. We (group of 5 adults) were seated in the most cramped space they could possibly have.

Attention by the wait staff was poor, kept waiting to order additional items.

The food is outstanding super creative and down right beautiful!  Service didn’t fall short either very attentive, but not over the top.  Cocktails are nice too.  It was our 2nd time there in two weeks, as we were excited to share our first experience with friends and family.  This time was a letdown, unfortunately, starting with an indifferent server who seemed to view us as more of a distraction than a customer, as a large party of the chef's friends had just arrived.  We were on our second appetizer before drinks arrived and tried to flag her down twice and she walked right past us.  The rest of the meal continued similarly, little attention from our server.  Fortunately, the rest of the staff and the host were amazing and picked up where she dropped the ball, but she really left a bad taste in our mouth.

Food was also a bit off from last week.  The pork belly and brisket were dry, and the noodles in the green curry were mushy.  It's sad because the curries themselves and the pad ke mow had amazing flavor!

Contrast this all with the incredible experience we had there a week and a half ago.  Our server was amazingly kind and attentive, every dish was a surprising burst of flavor and delicious.  And, even with our great server, the rest of the staff shined and were attentive and fun and made us feel at home.  We even made our next reservation before leaving that night.

The presentation was outstanding and the taste was quite yummy except that most of the dishes were a bit on the salty side for us. All of the dishes were beautiful and tasty, but of the dishes that we tried our favorites were the Surf & Turf beef jowls and the Pork Belly Curry.  Serving staff was excellent and batons expectation. First class. We had the sole and the massaman curry, wings, papaya salad, and oysters. The salad leafs were WET when it came out making the dish lack much of what we remembered the first go around. The chicken wings were ok, not much different than other chicken wings we have had.

Tonight, four of us ordered various dishes to share. The 'crying tiger' app's meat was savory, but the sticky rice seemed unnecessary and too bland and chewy; we really needed knives because the meat was a bit too chewy. The 'shrimp mousse toast' was decent, nothing special.  I normally like the 'drunken noodle' dish, but tonight's version included noodles that were overcooked and clumped together with tasty brisket meat that needed to be cut in smaller pieces since we had no knives; good flavors though.  The 'beef cheek green curry' had loads of flavor, but the meat was too fatty.  With the 'surf & turf' dish, I liked the crunchiness of the outer coating on the meat and the poached squid, but sadly the meat was a bit too fatty.  I didn't try the 'laab burger', but my husband liked it.  Although I like Jo's, I think the food has been inconsistent.  Three times, it has been very good, and twice it's just been good.

The view, service and food were excellent.  Great spot in the city with beautiful views and nice chill vibe. I would recommend this place for cocktails but not food.

The charcuterie board was laughable. Two tiny dollops of goat cheese and 2 very small cubes of hard cheese. 2 small slices of salami and maybe 3 slices of another cured meat! The board was mostly pickles mustard honey and bread! $38. This was even too small for 2 people… we were 6 people. Do not bother to order this! The main courses seemed substantial but overpriced!

The place is very nice with great view of the city from every corner of inside or outside seating. Highly recommended.  I was super excited to try this bar. It started out as a great experience, we got seated outside with a beautiful view, and then things went downhill quickly. The manager, Ryan, came up to my table and said, ""this table is reserved, you can't sit here"". I said, ""this is where your colleague sat us"". Ryan walked off and didn't say anything. I felt super uncomfortable. Five minutes later I saw Ryan walking by and I said, ""excuse me, did you get everything cleared up with your colleague"". Ryan responded in an annoyed tone, ""ya, why!?"". I explained that it made me feel very uncomfortable when he told me I wasn't supposed to be sitting there. He walked off, and as he was walking away I said, ""excuse me, what's your name?"". He shook his head without a response and continued walking. 

I've never experienced such rude behavior from a manager in my life. I eventually spoke with another manager named Travis, I explained the situation and he was extremely polite and understanding. I really appreciated that he took the time to listen to us, and was apologetic.

With all that sad, the food and drinks were both good, but I can't leave anything above 1-star with the rude behavior from Ryan. Read more The food could be better for the prices they charge.

They had to remake my drink as I had asked for one without an ingredient, but they were fine with it and though it took a while, I enjoyed it. ￼  We came for the experience of the handcrafted cocktails, and to be honest they were mediocre.
￼ I ordered the recommended handcrafted summer cocktail and it was way too sweet so I just asked for a classic margarita and it looks like that on my final bill I was charged for the full price versus the half of crafted cocktails.  We sat in the bar @ lunch time which was quiet & very pleasant. The full lunch menu was available and the openface salmon sandwich with fries was perfect.
Disappointed that 4oz. small pour of the $13 dry white wine not available only an $18-6oz of another variety. I ordered the $19 Paloma mixed drink instead. The Paloma was delicious but not a  very generous portion & served in a short drink glass vs a stemmed glass for better presentation? This is a large restaurant, why do you not have a  wine listed on the menu?

Still, the taste was excellent.

Desserts looked good but tasted quite bland, definitely a miss. The cocktails were very good! The service is very prompt and polite.

The restaurant itself is beautiful and the view is gorgeous, however they were VERY loudly playing tacky “stadium country” music. Literally, just loud white trash singing about trackers and such. That was extremely unpleasant and really ruined what should have been a wonderful ambiance.

The Linden is especially good. The house made bread is superb; fresh, hot, soft center, and a crust. Just yummy.

The meatball appetizer was a ten out of ten.

The linguine pesto was excellent and while it did say “cream sauce” we would have liked to see a more true pesto and slightly less cream.

The paparadelle was good, not great.  Seemed lack a bit of “oomph” for a lack of a better descriptor.

The cream brûlée was good, not great. It was not served in a traditional low-sided dish and when they flamed the sugar the dish got hit which melted the contents so it was not as firm as it should be.

Delicious food, amazing servers, great place to have a nice dinner  Shish kebab was tender and moist! Service was great.  This is a fabulous restaurant with high quality food, amazing service and ambiance, and yet a neighborhood feel.  This was our second time here and it was as terrific as we remembered .  Definitely a hidden gem!  I can only rave about the food, service, and overall experience at Taksim. The food is incredibly inventive and delicious- and, wonderfully reflective of Mediterranean and Turkish culture. The staff and service are top notch. I’ve been many times and consistently leave feeling satiated and taken care of. Highly recommend!  Delightful evening with friends. Good food and drink selection. Attentive and helpful service.  Taksim is a true gem! Absolutely delicious food, elegantly presented in a unique, airy, modern, industrial-like space that is tastefully decorate.
What else can I say? Very enjoyable dining experience all around!  We went early so not crowded or very noisy but I imagine it gets loud in the industrial interior. The food was fantastic - Try the lamb carpaccio, the crunchy shrimp, and the wheat berry risotto! The service was a good team, kept us watered up good and the pace of service was perfect. The waiter explained nuances of food and made sure we got maximal enjoyment. ",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/47217641.webp

The menu is not as large or varied as it used to be with flatbreads and several salads but what is there is fine. At least the cheeseburger that my picky wife found perfectly cooked and very tasty. And the Butcher steak that I had which was also delicious. Also the chocolate mousse dessert was to die for!  Our pre theater meal was excellent. THe space has energy that feels dynamic but not noisy -- most people either going to Berkeley Rep or the Aurora or Freight and Salvage.

Definitely on our list for future pre-theater nights out.  Everything was wonderful except we asked the bartender to close the window - it was windy and cold. He said no because he was too hot.

I suggested she give me a full glass and comp it. I wasn’t sure how long bug was in my glass and felt creepy seeing same amount. She did comp it in the end. Clams and linguine good but rather soupy this time  Whenever I am in town, my good friend and I go to Paradiso… every time. We always sit in the high table room and it’s our favorite spot.

All in all  a home run! Read more What an absolute experience having dinner here. The food was amazing and delicious. Nothing short of perfection! I definitely recommend anyone to come eat here and I will return!  This place was really weird, it’s wall to wall carpeting which I don’t love in a restaurant, food was alright  Food is excellent as is the service once they acknowledge you.  Props to Jose who is very personable and ensured we were taken care of during our meal.  If you're looking for more private conversation, try to book the booths with curtains.  Will return to Bobo's on our next trip back to San Francisco.  They have cut the steak sizes and what used to be a phenomal bone-in filet is now just a slightly above average steak. I don't object to the smaller size steak, as they do offer the larger cut, but the way the butcher cut the steak and the way it was cooked produced an inferior product from what they produced pre-pandemic. They also lowered the quality of their side dishes. They were good, but they used to be great. The modern Mac is a good example of what used to be stellar and is now still very tasty, but less than what it used to be. Read more Though I have lived a few blocks away from Bobo's for more than two decades, this was my first visit to this delightful gem. The four-course Prix Fixe menu can't be beat. My dining companion and I each enjoyed the chowder and the petite filet with mash and creamed spinach, the ""bread service"" on the side, and the vanilla ice cream, all of which were delicious and perfectly sized. The filet is probably among the best I've had — perfectly seasoned and charred, no salt/pepper/sauce necessary. The place itself is really interesting — a funky and whimsical vibe, good 80s music that allows for conversation at normal volume, and not at all loud despite its being on busy Lombard Street. Service by Jose was top-notch — attentive and friendly without being pushy. There are private rooms available and I may book one for my next birthday party or something. One way or another, I'll be back for sure! 💯 Read more Fantastic steak and sizzling platter with crab, mussels, and prawns.  Took a few friends for a celebration and we had the best time.  The food was delicious and well-portioned. Service was lovely as always!  We did everything family style, which I would recommend if you're going with a few people, it makes things easier. We shared the Tomahawk, which was plenty of steak for us along with apps, salads, and sides.  The steak was cooked to perfection btw.

Our waiter was incredibly informative but there was a too long lag time in placing our order, paying the bill, etc., but I can’t fault the waiter, I think there were only three waiters that night?

You'll find fresh seafood-forward dishes on our menu including pizza, pasta and more, which pair perfectly with creative cocktails from our bar and an extensive list of Italian wines. Come in for lunch, happy hour, or a quick dinner before a show. Host birthday parties and get togethers in our private dining room. From our cozy and intimate atmosphere to our knowledgeable and attentive service, Corzetti invites you to savor the essence of Liguria's relaxed seaside culture in the heart of the city.","Read more Great food and atmosphere. Wait staff guided us through the menu. No bad suggestions. Would highly recommend.  The service was very good. Hostess was accommodating and the Bistecca was a good cut of meat. I think the sauce it was sitting on could have been a lesser portion. The potatoes were great with it.  Great martini along with tasty pasta. A great pre-theater dinner  Solid experience! We made an early reservation here before a 6pm show and really enjoyed this place. The service was prompt and attentive. For appetizers, we got the focaccia and meatballs (yum!). The mains, we all got pasta including the Corzetti dish, pesto dish and orecchiette dish. We all cleared our plates. We got the N/A beverage which was perfectly bitter/not too sweet and refreshing. Our server was great. My only challenge with the place was the round tables were large and I felt far away from my guests - plus, the space was very loud, even at 4:30! But I’d definitely return.

Yelling, cheering, clapping--6 people who could care less how their behavior affected others. The restaurant server and host claimed there was nothing that could be done about it, although they made no effort at all.

What can be done about it is that we will never go back. No matter how good the food, if you can't have a conversation at your own table due to rude and out of control guests, it's a waste of money.

I cannot recommend this restaurant as a pleasant dining experience. Read more I had a great experience and would definitely come back to this restaurant.

My cocktail was well-executed, and I liked the menu choices, which were fairly standard (not crazy reinventions) but with prime ingredients. The food was well-prepared and tasty.

Pippal celebrates the country’s many diverse culinary regions, in a fast and casual environment."," Very interesting Indian food, a mixture of offerings from the North (Punjab, Rajasthan) and from the South. Our starters, gongura chicken and dahi vada (lentil fritters in a yogurt sauce with tamarind and mint chutney) were absolutely delicious. We could have chosen better for the main courses. The dungeness crab with Goan spices was slightly overcooked--roasting too long makes the crabmeat shrivel, dry out, and stick to the shell, though it makes the shell very easy to crack--but the southern Indian sauce with it was excellent. I was curious to try the beef asado, since this is a dish rarely found and then only in Catholic or Muslim areas of Indian. (Hindus tar and feather those they suspect of eating beef.) It was served on a puffy naan, like a beef pizza, and the Goan spices didn't manage to give it enough flavor (the beef also would have had a bit more taste if cooked slightly less), while the chewy puffy naan didn't have much either--the restaurant's thinner regul;ar chili naan was far better--though it was very good when dipped in the spicy sauce for the crab. We had to wait too long for our main dishes, for a reason not clear to me.I  suspect that other main dishes are better and look forward to exploring more of the very creative menu. With the meal we drank an excellent and reasonably-priced Willamette Valley pinot noir. Service was knowledgeable , friendly, and efficient, particular our server Ressard, with whom we enjoyed talking. This restaurant is more upscale than most Indian restaurants, and prices are correspondingly higher. On this chilly evening the restaurant was a bit cold inside. It was also quite noisy at first, even though not jam-packed, very resonant because of the high ceiling  and lack of sound-absorbing surfaces. I think it deserves a more upscale location than the Emery Bay shopping mall, as would befit its aspirations, and should have one that accommodates restrooms inside, instead of sending clients out to those of the mall. Read more The food and drinks were amazing!! Our server , Rushad was fabulous. He knew the menu really well and whatever he recommended was awesome!
We will definitely go back and recommend our friends/family.
A suggestion though: Pls add to the menu some green vegetables like palak paneer.
Thanks! Read more Food is good but way to spicy no good options for kids  Beautiful , fun , delicious restaurant with great service.
Try everything but s=especially the butter chicken, the sliders, the shrimp , the sample chutneys and the MOMOs. I love the Red Fort cocktail.  Pippal offers a delightful culinary experience with its authentic Indian cuisine and inviting atmosphere. The service was attentive and friendly, making us feel welcome from the moment we arrived.

The food was truly exceptional. The Litti-Chokha was a flavorful delight, with the perfectly cooked litti and the tangy chokha complementing each other beautifully. The Amritsari Kulche was another standout, with its crisp exterior and flavorful filling. However, the lassi portion seemed a bit on the small side, which was a minor disappointment.

Overall, Pippal is a fantastic spot for those seeking delicious Indian food and a pleasant dining experience. Read more Everything was perfect, we just felt the portion size of entrees could have been slightly bigger , for the price it felt , it was little less. The extra condiments were not necessary that came with our food.
Amritsar i kulcha and bisi bele bhaat was our entree. For 4 people we paid $242 , no alcohol.  Reason for 4 stars as our bill had 2 extra entrees on it., my husband doesn't really check the receipt closely.. thankfully I did. If I had not caught that we would have paid $45 more.. they corrected it but this shouldn't happen. Makes me wonder if I need to check my previous billls. :)
5 stars on food, ambience, service otherwise Read more My first time there, I was expecting a more intimate setting, however it more casual and being in the Bay Street Mall was unexpected. I will go back, the food is worth the Mall experience.  Wonderful food. I thought I didn’t like Indian food until I came here and tasted their momo, paneer and curry.

I wish there would be an announcement to hush the audience when the musicians speak on the microphone.   10/10, would come back.  The space is fantastic. The music is always great. The staff is friendly and efficient. The drinks are good. The food, however, is not. Fresh ingredients but poor execution of dim sum. Things are salty, sour, bland, mushy, and/or overcooked. Mr. Tipple’s is so close to being epic, if they’d just get the food dialed in.  Polite staff, good music, stylish space. Spicy chicken wontons were amazing. Cucumber salad was meh, needed to be pickled more and/or have more vinegar.  Didn’t receive all item ordered.

It is my third time there. One thing I would change is water glasses. They are just too small and there were four of us and all felt same way.   Usher needed to constantly refill glasses where they could have been of use somewhere. Or else put a carafe of water on table.  The zucchini fries are great to share as a starter. Loved the Classic Original Joe’s Parmesan chicken. Last time I had the fabulous Kale salad.  Carlo, our server was phenomenal, just super personable, great sense of humor, thoughtful and efficient! Thank you so much, Carlo!  Really nice experience & atmosphere. You have the recipe to success down!  Susan was excellent.  Most other servers were rushing to clear our table.

My vegetarian husband enjoyed the Huevos Ranchero for brunch, and then it was removed from the menu.  Then he started ordering the tomato soup and corn pizza, but it was also removed from the menu.  He liked the Avocado Toast, but the dish he served today was very different.  The ""toast"" was a piece of crusty bread that was more than an inch high.  It was impossible to eat as a finger food.  Even with a knife and fork, it was difficult to eat and the bread:topping ratio was way too high.  My go-to dish is the Ancient Grains bowl.  It happens to be vegan but each component is a savory cuminy flavor bomb.  The various ingredients can be combined to form a variety of flavorful bites.

That being said, my experience was an overall let down. Though the prices are economical, I was scoffed at when I requested the Pommes Dauphine be removed from our bill after it was served with a worm wiggling around in the honey side dish. The Mediera wine specialist was interesting, perhaps a bit rude requesting my guest and I share a glass for his tasting, but overall he disregarded my two requests to purchase a bottle of wine to take home.

Read more Horrible experience. Food took ages to get to our table, when we ordered fairly easy stuff (take the lid off the caviar, shouldn’t be that hard). We finished our drinks before anything got there, which we had ordered to pair with the food. No one checked on us or told us the food would be taking a while. Impossible to get the waiters attention to even ask about the status. Flight pours say 3oz on the menu, the pours were less than that. Finally got our check and the waiter messed it up twice. Once double charging us for oysters and a second, charging us a random amount for the caviar (more than the one we picked, but also not the price of any on the menu). We gave feedback and said we were disappointed by the experience especially since we were expecting high quality with the name Saison attached to it. The managers response was “Well that’s Saison, that’s not us”. Sorry it’s SAISON WINE BAR. You are affiliated so it’s easy to assume we would be going somewhere with good service, communication and food. Will not be returning and I let my network know not to bother coming either. Read more It’s new and drawing attention from Gen Z  - for its generous Happy Hour. It’s more than that -  it’s good food. A pointed menu with focused execution . I hope this culinary spot lasts.  I had high hopes, especially given the team behind it (Saisons). Sadly, it fell short and turned what was supposed to be a special 18th-anniversary date night into a disappointment.

First off, the noise level was the highest I've experienced in 15 years living in SF. It was impossible to hold a conversation, and even the staff had to shout just to speak to us. This alone made it difficult to enjoy the evening.

I mentioned in my reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary. While I wasn’t expecting anything special, a simple acknowledgment from the staff would have gone a long way :-)

The croque monsieur, cheeses, Bordier butter with radishes stood out - however portions are fairly small (4 pommes dauphines for $16++) and prices were steep. The markup on the wine flights (only 3 oz ea.) was 6-7x, which felt a bit excessive. To top it off, our sides arrived well before the entrees, and by the time the mains came, the sides had gone cold.

On the positive side, the staff was pleasant and seemed to care.

Overall, at this price point ($100-150 pp.), it was pretty sad and disappointing. We'll have to find another place to celebrate...

p.s. 24% (18% + 6%) auto-gratuity Read more It was fabulous and well priced. Great value. Paul was an outstanding host as well as the staff. Wine selection was superb and the chicken mousse was the best I’ve ever had. Paul was extremely generous and treated us to a Madera tasting!  Lovely edition to the neighborhood!

From the moment you step inside, you're greeted by a warm ambiance, soft lighting, and a curated selection of wines and champagne. To complement the exquisite wines, Saison offers a delectable menu of small bites and charcuterie. The caviar is a must-try, with high-quality caviar served with all the traditional accompaniments. The cheese selection is equally impressive, featuring carefully curated options of artisanal cheeses. The croque monsieur is so good you'll think you're in France.

We are glad that the crispy mushrooms are still on the menu. Don't even take those away! The mushroom ceviche was excellent. Please re-name the melon gazpacho; it's nothing like gazpacho and misleads the diner. Others in my party had the Not Paaella which was very good and on of the pastas, which they always do well. The tamalas had good flavor but were a bit dry. Needs more sauce. The BBQ platter was tasty; I'd say the lentil cake was more like a meatloaf than anything.

Server was good outside of his first comment, food was good as always.

We booked a 9pm reservation on Open Table for a Sunday night due to an out of town arrival coming in late (8pm at SFO) which was confirmed for that day and time.

On the way to the restaurant, I googled a16 in the marina so I could pull up directions.  When viewing Google results, it shows they close at 9.

So I call to make sure that the reservation is good and still open at that time.  The person who answered the call said that it was good, but we had to hurry and order because the kitchen closes at 9.

First interaction when we were seated is that the kitchen closes at 9 so we have to order right away.  My brother flying in from DC was in an Uber and set to arrive at 9:06.

Why are you scheduling reservations at 9pm if you’re going to rudely tell customers that they have to hurry to sit and order because your chef closes the kitchen at 9 and you’ll ask him if he can hold it for a few minutes until the third person arrives.

We were celebrating our engagement with my brother only to immediately be told twice that we were essentially an inconvenience.  For reference, we had no intention to stay long and we weren’t even near the last people in the restaurant (out the door by 10:10).

As mentioned outside of the two interactions with staff basically telling us we were inconveniencing them by submitting a reservation in their system at 9pm, the food was good and we enjoyed the hour. So, I’m torn on how I feel about this experience.

Love the location/dining setup/food, but the staff is questionable and clearly they need to remove reservations after 830 if they’re going to treat people that way (I could maybe see a bit more of their annoyance as valid if we were larger than a party of 3 and did not make a reservation through their website link).

Prices were high as expected.  From our perspective this is definitely a special occasion destination.  Excellent service and food.  Went there to celebrate a birthday and becoming newly re-employed. It was a great choice and would love to go back.  The experience was great overall, but the mocktails can improve. We ordered the Yuzu Shiso and Orange Cream. Both tasted well but had way too much ice. I felt like I paid for two glasses of ice with a hint of flavor. Otherwise the experience was high quality and we had a good time.  Had a wonderful time celebrating my birthday here. The food was amazing and the service was exceptional.  We are at the chef’s counter in front of the hearth.

We like to order a few tapas and a paella and take the leftover paella home to enjoy the next day. It’s a fun date night or dinner with friends!  Great food, paella was tasty but a bit salty. Tapas let you try lots of different dishes. Brunch dishes were delicious.  The tapas were excellent, the service was great (they accommodated us adding one more person to our reservation last minute), and they had a guitarist playing Spanish flamenco music which was a nice touch. Minus a star because our paella mixta was very burnt at the bottom of the pan when they brought it out to us. Paella usually has a nice, crunchy layer from being cooked in the flat pan, but not burnt. Also, they didn’t have quite a few menu items (drinks, tapas, entrees and dessert) but they were still listed on the menu. Read more VERY delicious food.   Tapas were tasty and the 2 Paellas we had were marvelous.  Nice wine list .  We'll be back!  I have to start off by saying I feel sorry for the chefs. This review is not reflective of the food. We went out for an anniversary dinner, planned way ahead, and were told when we showed up for our 8 o’clock reservation at 7:45 that we would have to wait two hours and that we might not get in. What is the point of a reservation! They didn’t even try to compensate us or feel remorseful in anyway. It was 8:30 by the time we left and couldn’t get in anywhere else. Will not go back even though the food smelled great. Read more We waited one hour for our table. We had a reservation at 7:30 and were seated at 8:30. If they can’t accommodate reservations they should not be on OpenTable  The food and service was good. The music and noise level were a little too loud for us. We had to shout to hear each other.
We were there on a Saturday night and that might be why.  We enjoyed our meal very much, as did our guests. The room is very noisy for people with hearing aids, but being seated in the window helped a lot. Both the staff and we were confused by the $20 reservation fee from Open Table. They weren’t aware of it, and it seems a bit rude. We were advised to just call the restaurant directly next time. And hope our money will be refunded. Read more Food was good. Did not care much for the service we got. We (group of 5 adults) were seated in the most cramped space they could possibly have. Basically slammed 2 tables (for 2) together and put another chair at the end. We were cramped and didn't have room to put our water glasses down without shoving the next person.

Attention by the wait staff was poor, kept waiting to order additional items.

I doubt I would go there again.

I try my best to cook Dominican food at home sometimes but having a restaurant quality option is good to have!

The ambience is fun, they play Dominican music and the service was great! I can imagine it being a lively place when it’s busy. I was actually shocked that they weren’t packed on a Saturday night.

We ordered the pernil, maduro, yellow rice, whole fried fish that comes with bacalao sauce and kidney beans. Everything was so good and cooked well. The Pernil was moist and tender, the fish was crispy but still moist inside, the maduro was crispy around the edges, perfection! The only thing we didn’t like was the sauce that came with the fish (bacalao) but that was my fault for ordering it bc we personally aren’t big fans of bacalao in general. It would be great if they offered options on what kind of sauce we want with the whole fried fish, I don’t see too many people in the west coast enjoying that sauce either.

We would 1000% come back! Probably for lunch so we can try the chimiburger. They should offer this during dinner also. I’d also like to try their seafood menu, unsure when they offer that but it wasn’t on the menu.

I’d also suggest that they build a little barricade/fence around the outdoor patio because we all know it gets freezing at night year round. I’m glad I brought my own blankets for us to use because the heat lamps don’t do much when the wind blows. Read more Too many dishes not available. Pernil, moro, appetizers. It’s a small menu if you take 1 of 6 main courses off it really messes with the value.  Everything was  very nice. The food was wonderful and the staff very friendly and helpful.

Absolutely amazing food! The ribs were transcendent. Highly recommend  alaMar was sooo good! i loved everything i ordered; the oxtail and garlic udon noodles were my absolute favorite and the drink, frio frio was great! i am visiting the bay and i know i will be back the next time i visit!  Chairs are extremely uncomfortable and the music is extremely loud - to the point where I cannot hear my friend talk.  Other tables were drinking and extremely loud ruining my evening.  It's sad that people don't know how to behave in public and ruining things for others.  Upon restaurant entry, I was approached by a homeless person.

Like most restaurants, alaMar neglected to update their online menu with the selection and prices.  Overall, food was flavourful.  Standouts include the Camaranoes Criolla and the Fritura de Chivo.  The Dominican Slow Roasted Pork Ribs were a bit dry and the meat (inside) can use more flavour.  The Pollo Frito was a bit dry and the Pernil was lacklustre in flavour and texture - tasted like pork roast smothered was sauce.  The Dominican Mofongo was on point.  Dessert selection appears to be boring so I skipped it. Read more Both John and Jessica were outstanding servers. Professional, courteous, attentive. The food was off tha hook! I am definitely making this at a minimum a no-monthy place to eat!  Food was amazing! Quite possibly the best plantains I’ve ever had.

Cocktails were absolutely fantastic, as was the fried goat. They already had run out of the fish entree by 7pm, and it was the only non-meat entree except for the noodles, so I was forced to get the noodles. They were delicious but I’m a low carb girlie and my husband ended up eating them. Service was awesome! Overall, a scrumptious experience and we will definitely be back. Read more The food is excellent and authentic. I have spent a lot of time in the Dominican Republic and can say that they're doing a great job.

We enjoyed our dinner with friends. The Bun cha was delicious and the special short ribs very succulent. The mocktails were excellent. It was a tad pricey but manageable. $250 for 4 including tax and tip. 5 dishes.
Would definitely recommend to others.  Great cocktails! Good choice of small plates, large, hot and cold. Specials very interesting and our waiter was helpful.  The waiter checked our group's allergies with the chef, told us we were good to order a specific dish, and then much later told us that it was not good with our allergies. So we had to order something new  Really fantastic. Loved all the food. This time ordered off the menu, did pre-fix last time and also loved that experience.

The restaurant was as you would expect busy on a Saturday night. We were seated in a timely fashion, and the greeters were very friendly and very attentive. The serving staff was excellent took care of us exchanging plates and bringing most of what we asked for.  The barbecue itself was outstanding perfectly cooked and there was plenty.  Just WOW! First time. This place was great. The servers were all wonderful. Camila was our waitress.. so sweet.
We did the “experience”, which is the salad bar and then meat constantly being brought to your table.
We had to practically roll out of this restaurant. It was all so good.  This place is offer you a high quality food w good price. I definitely recommend for the meat lovers.  Milton and Pablo was so nice to us. Pablo literally went to kitchen to bring us a beef rib specially. We would definitely come back.  Amazing experience!!!  Thank you!!  It was our first time and it was so good !! The garlic meat was the best  Food is always good, but service wasn’t all that great.  First - 10/10 for Pablo Gaucho.

I had a poor start to my experience one busy Friday evening for dinner. Despite having a reservation (for 1, might I add), I was the last of five parties to be seated, even after folks without a reservation. Once seated, I waited over 10 minutes and not once did anyone offer me a menu or even water. I ended up fixing myself a plate at the salad bar, came back to my table, ate most of the plate, and still nothing and nobody. I pulled aside one of the meat runners to ask if someone can serve me, at least with a menu and a glass of water. A young woman was quickly assigned to me and I could tell she knew I was pretty upset at my experience thus far so she kept her responses and service quite curt (which only made my mood worse).

I was incredibly disappointed at this initial impression that parties without a reservation get seated before parties with a reservation, and once seated, absolutely no service offered for THAT long! Imagine how much longer I would have had to wait if I never asked one of the gentlemen if I could have a server (I’m laughing as I type this because this was so sad. Seriously, Fogo?)

However, over the next hour to follow, my mood improved once I had water and was given a green/red card, allowing the kind staff to offer me their meat cut offerings. I have to commend most of the staff, particularly the gentlemen, for their kindness and professionalism. They were incredibly warm, attentive, and approached me with offerings often. I am particularly writing this review for/about Pablo Gaucho. Thank you to the gentlemen this evening who made my evening! 10/10 for them and them only. Read more Muy buena experiencia lleve a mi novio a que cenáramos por su cumpleaños y quedó encantado del lugar  We arrived fairly early for dinner. Staff was friendly and helpful and sat us quickly. However, the salad bar was already in quite a state. Most dishes were missing their identification so we did not know what things were. The ice was dirty in places (mostly with food mess) and some things were missing. There seemed to be plenty of staff so I do not know why they were not keeping up the salad bar better. The cocktails were also very weak - not even sure there was anything in them!!! 
However, the meats were fantastic. Staff were coming around with options constantly and were giving generous portions! Read more Great food! Love the presentation of the salad bar! Excellent service!

I recently dined at Morton’s in San Francisco, expecting the high level of service and quality that the restaurant is known for, but unfortunately, my experience fell far short of expectations.

From the moment I arrived at 8:39 PM, the service was slow and inattentive. Despite being seated promptly, I waited **over an hour** without receiving even the basic elements of the dining experience, such as bread and water refills. After multiple attempts to get the attention of the staff, it wasn’t until **9:40 PM** that my food finally arrived—without any prior updates or explanations for the delay.

While the food itself met the usual standards of Morton’s, the lengthy wait and lack of communication from the staff significantly impacted my overall experience. Given the reputation and price point of Morton’s, I expected much better service. I hope this was an isolated incident, but it has left me hesitant to return in the future. I was brought a menu again after 40 minutes because another server thought I had been waiting to be served. When asking for the manager, they never brought him over and he ignored me trying to wave him down. Read more Morton’s è una certezza se vuoi mangiare la carne .

Fantastic service with wonderful wine list and amazing dishes such as tuna tartar with mango, halibut and snob hill pizza.  Cloudless chocolate cake and Pana cotta were over the top delicious.

A little noisy and pricey, but worth it!  Everything at this restaurant is fantastic.  It was the first time I had dined there.  The service, staff, food was amazing.  The food was out of this world.  If you haven't been there, you should make a point of going.  I took my mom here as she was visiting for the weekend. We absolutely loved Aziza. It has a serene interior reminiscent of an elegant evening in Morocco. All the staff we interacted with were friendly and passionate for sharing their food and culture with us.

The Moroccan Syrah was delicious. For starters, we ordered both the cauliflower and the eggplant. Both were a dazzling blend of flavors and perfectly cooked.

We had been walking all day and were desperately thirsty; the staff were sharply attentive and never let our carafe go dry.

I ordered the salmon tagine and mom ordered the shakshuka. Both were exquisite. Honestly though, the star was the cornbread. I grew up on dry, box-mix cornbread and was hesitant to order it. It came out on a warm cast iron pan looking all dreamy and served with a fluffy harissa butter — harissa is this blend of peppers and spices. My goodness.

I’d absolutely return! Read more Service was very slow, but otherwise great experience.  Came here for dinner to celebrate my friend’s birthday and mine also. I had not been here since they had remodeled the restaurant years ago.
We had an amazing meal! Ordered several starters, based on the recommendations of our server. We started with the delicious Little Gem Salad, then mostly chose from the “Smaller” items on the menu. We ordered the eggplant,mussels,kefta, broccolini, and the amazing cornbread with harissa butter. My friend and I thought this was the best cornbread we’ve ever had! We were so full and couldn’t even order dessert, but they brought out candles and two just baked chocolate chip cookies. Only could eat one and took the other one home. We are definitely coming back to try the main entrees. Highly recommend this place!!!

Michelin Bib Gourmand 2016 - 2019"," It was awesome. Just a very real fun place serving amazing Thai food. It could’ve been right out of Thailand. Amazing flavors, fun environment and a great meal for the price.  Food was absolutely delicious and so were the cocktails. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the server was rushing us. We had a 7:30 reservation and when we checked in with the host they told us they close at 8:30. Then the server reminded us multiple times and was rushing us through the entire meal which did not make it enjoyable. They should have their last reservation at 7:00 if they are so strict about closing at 8:30. Heads up, make an earlier reservation so you can enjoy the food. Read more It was great to celebrate my birthday 🎉 I will come back next year!  Always a fun time and great food. Pumpkin fries and green curry
Short Rib noodles were excellent
Mango sticky blue rice was a surprise dessert.  Sat outside in the tented area. It needs fans, too many flies and it was hot & stuffy. Asked for no meat, but brought us bone broth; then waitresses acted annoyed that we didn’t touch it.  A little pricier than other Thai restaurants but the dishes are more interesting and complex.  The samosas have a delicate flaky crust and delicious filling. We really liked the Herbal Rice Salad- colorful in appearance and taste. There are a lot of different flavors and textures that really make this salad delicious. The Neua Num Tok Rolls are very good- good quality beef and the vinagrette compliments it well.  The roti mataba was tasty but not our favorite.  The coconut granita on vanilla ice cream is very tasty and unique Read more This was my birthday treat to myself after reading reviews and seeing pictures. The inside is not very big, dining time is limited, which is stated on their site. I didn't receive the birthday song or anything special nor was I asked if I was celebrating anything special. I booked through their site which led me to open table where I entered I was celebrating my birthday; however, I got a text from Yelp saying the restaurant uses Yelp and to confirm on Yelp if I was still coming for my reservation. I also confirmed on OpenTable when I got that message.
The dining experience is truly for IG/social media. The taste of the food was mid, my favorites was the mango sticky rice. The Panang Neua came in second, it is a slow braised short rib, it was fall off the bone tender, but it was spicy which is not denoted on the menu. It wasn't extremely spicy, but I wasn't expecting a kick. The blue rice is just that..blue and no flavor, the broccolini served with the dish could have been cooked a bit longer, it was too crunchy for me. The Neua Num Tok rolls were my least favorite. This dish has mint, steak, and cucumber and cilantro in a cilantro lime vinaigrette. Steak and mint is a combo that I didn't find particularly appealing. So I just ate the steak and cucumber. Now for the drink, Hello Gorgeous. It is cute and comes with flashing lights, and was good.
I can say I visited, the food /drinks were ok, but this place in my opinion is for the ""IG worthy pictures"" price tag was over $100 for my meal ( oh I ordered a coke...it was a canned coke). I wouldn't visit again, if you want those pictures, by all means visit. My server ""Nice"" was just that..nice and he checked on me when needed.
I was looking forward to the birthday song honestly, that is my favorite part of dining on my birthday. I choose places that offer the song.
If you haven't visited, check this place out and perhaps it will be your favorite spot! Read more Always fantastic food at Farmhouse - one of our favorite places  Great restaurant, buzzy atmosphere and food and drinks are delicious. They called last orders at 8pm on a Wednesday though! Must be a SF thing….  I loved the way Farmhouse looks. GREAT place. I ordered the Tom Ka Gai soup and I stress the word soup. I was alone so I ordered a small bowl. Here's where I was confused. The broth itself was fantastic. I make this soup often and this was the best broth I have ever tasted in the US. It was served in the tiniest little cup over crowded with what looked like 3/4 cup of big chunks of dry over cooked chicken breast meat.  I had to remove all of the dry tasteless chicken to get to this little tiny amount of soup. When I order soup I expect to be able to dip a spoon into a bowl of broth with small things floating in the bowl.  I asked about the size of the bowl but the server did not understand what I was saying and told me ""everyone is entitled to their opinion"". I just did not understand the chicken chunks. Oh my god that soup broth was amazing. 
I tried the egg rolls but they were so tasteless stuffed with cellophane noodles and cabbage. NO flavor...and the ""peanut sauce"" was chili oil. Eggrolls were fried in old oil. Not happy but took them home to someone. I'm a chef so maybe expect more when I'm out.  I just booked a trip to Chiang Mai and look forward to Thai food when I'm there.

My daughter is gluten free and Peter had the chefs make all the dishes gluten free except one. My daughter and her boyfriend loved the food. My only feedback is the sauces were a little heavy.

Excellent service throughout, amazing sea food and wonderful Californian wines, desserts we wonderful. Recommend this restaurant, definitely book before as this restaurant is busy at weekends!  The food was good but small portions for the amount that was charged. The view is amazing and the staff was great. Only downside is that if you don’t have cash for the valet he will ask you to pay inside and walk the receipt back outside to him. I’m not sure if I was racially profiled when asked to bring the receipt back outside before even eating or if this is protocol but either way not a great business practice. I would re-think that.

Can't beat the view- direct view of Treasure Island. Great location- at the end of Broadway in SF.  Lovely day on the bay and a window table. Lunch was not crowded, and service was quick. Was not in any rush. Food was tasty but pricey. Well worth extra for the view.  The service was good, but the food did not meet our  expectations. The real estate is far better than the food.

We started with a complimentary glass of blood orange sparkling juice and beef on a crustini with a delicious truffle aoli. Then we each had a hamachi shooter. You can order them by 2, 4 or 6. Since we were getting the tasting menu, we only got one. They are delicious! We started with the abalone which was quite tender. Then the scallops, so delicious. And then the dory, which was delicious with an eggplant base. The steak was delicious and tender. The husband upgraded to the waygu. And we ordered the scallop risotto cuz it just sounded so good. And it was so creamy and full of flavor! You have to try it. We then got our dessert which was a matcha crème, but it was hard to cut into with a spoon, a fork would have been better. There was a light matcha flavor, but otherwise didn’t taste like much. Not sweet. I would pass on the dessert. They also gave us a celebratory chocolate cake for his birthday. And of course the cotton candy. I wanted to take it home and asked for a bag. Jonathan our waiter gave us a fresh cotton candy to go. The cherry flavor was distinct. And Jonathan and his staff took very good care of us. He also takes good photos for you. Read more Great experience and good food.  We liked our waiter Jonathan.  The whole team was very helpful and friendly.  Food very good. Cocktails good and the space is nice. The service is a bit disjointed. Lots of staff but they don’t seem to be very efficient.

The person who brought our plates was very helpful with explaining our dishes. The bread was fresh, my favorite was the croissants. The grilled octopus had a nice crisp.

There was also a Margarita flight served in basically a round shot glass. Only one of the three margaritas was palatable. The Blood Orange was good, but the Spicy Pineapple and El Pomelo were awful. They were way too acidic and not flavorful. We chose the grilled grass-fed 4oz sliced tenderloin as our entree (Korean Noodle Bowl & Chicken Parmesan were the other choices). It was too well done and there was perhaps a teaspoon of cheesy mashed potatoes with a few other veggies on the plate. The chocolate peanut butter tart was okay. We spoke with the GM about our meals.

The Korean word ‘Bansang’ refers to the style of table setting for the kings and nobles of the Joseon, a Korean dynastic kingdom that prospered for more than five centuries. At Bansang, we wish to serve all of our guests with the same care and sincerity as the chefs did for their royalty in those times past.

Korean fare is built around enjoying various distinctive types of dishes simultaneously rather than in separate courses, as this allows every person to experience continuously changing flavor combinations unique to Korean culture. Our guests can expect a modern, creative perspective on this traditional style of Korean cuisine.","Read more Food was amazing but recommending 14 dishes for 6 people was overkill, would order less next time VS what the server says which also would’ve helped us on the $$bill$$. Otherwise amazing!  The food was good but would not recommend this for groups as the portions are just too small to be shared by more than two people. I didn’t mind the smaller portions except for the fried rice which was really just amusingly small (it’s rice!). Overall would recommend for groups of 2.  Overpriced. Kimchi fried rice was amazing. The oysters were amazing.  Rice cakes were great. Truly one of the best appetizers I’ve eaten in some time. Other meals were good too. However, we ordered the ribeye and it came room temperature. We’ve asked if that’s how it’s supposed to be and were told that yes as it was prepared beforehand. Frankly hard to believe. We’ve had steaks in many places and they always come warm.

Hospitality in ancient Greece is a timeless tradition deeply woven into the fabric of its culture. In the Mediterranean, a region historically known as a melting pot of diverse cultures and cuisines, this spirit of hospitality was not only a virtue but a sacred duty. From the early times of city-states to the present day, the people of Greece have welcomed weary travelers as if they were guests from the gods themselves. This tradition is a testament to the enduring values of generosity, kindness, and warmth that have characterized Greek society for millennia. Whether it’s a simple offering of food and shelter or the sharing of stories and experiences, the essence of Greek hospitality remains as vibrant and essential today as it was in the days of Homer’s epic tales.","Read more Delicious food cook to perfection, great service and great ambiance.

Lovely dining room that was quite quiet on a Sunday night.  Our meal at Saffron Kitchen was a total delight. We ate on the patio on a beautiful summer night. The windows to the main dining room were open as well, so people inside could enjoy the weather as well. The food was all delicious. The two of us shared the Salmon Kara'e -- fresh, moist salmon in a tomato-flavored sauce with an abundance of carrots, peppers, and onions: savory but not heavy or rich. And we had a Greek salad -- a beautiful array of lettuces, multi-colored grape tomatoes, feta, and kalamata olives in a refreshing lemony vinaigrette (a large bowl, heaped high). The prices are not cheap ($24 for the salmon, $18 for the salad), but unlike many fine dining restaurants in the Bay, the portions were truly generous. These two orders were plenty for two of us, we even took a side-sized serving of the salad home. The meal was accompanied by a seeded focaccia-like bread that was not extraordinary but was fresh and warm. The servers were consistently attentive and hospitable -- they seemed very eager for us to enjoy our meal. And when one guest unexpectedly showed up to sit on the patio with a dog, the manager -- who could have been disconcerted (a dog in a white-tablecloth restaurant?) -- hustled quickly to find the dog a water bowl.

Simply thrilled to have this special spot! Read more Food & service were fantastic! Steak frites & artichoke soup were my favorite!  We were disappointed with our visit.  I wanted to write a good review for a new place, but I cannot.  We were there on a Friday evening, it was pretty slow.  The space is very nice.  Service was just OK.  They were a bit slow in bringing our cocktails.  Also we were half way done with main course before the wine was poured, that really annoys me.  I want wine while I eat my dinner.  The main course came out quickly after the appetizer, so perhaps he didn't have time to get the wine.  The main issue was the food.  We were disappointed with the charcuterie plate.  It had only had 2 meats, a sausage and a ham/prosciutto. For $26, I expect more of a selection, some pate etc.  There were pickled vegetables on the plate.  Other than gherkin , I've never seen pickled vegetables on a charcuterie plate.  We had the Faux Fillet for 2.  Again a disappointment.  we ordered medium rare, what arrived was medium well.  We sent it back, this time it came out cooked properly, there was a nice char on the outside.  However the cut of meat was not that good.  Again for $82, I expected a better piece of beef.  The chocolate mousse was good.  The other 2 people enjoyed their meal:  onion tart, avocado salad, sole & bavette steak.  I guess we just ordered the wrong thing.  Perhaps they are still getting their footing after 2 months. Read more Portions were not large but perfect such that I could have an appetizer, main, and desert comfortably. By the glass wines were great and the setting was wonderful to catch up with a friend.  Our food was delicious and the service was wonderful! I expect this place to be a dining destination after it gets discovered  Fabulous waitress and fabulous food!  Highly recommend  Overall it was a pleasant dining experience with nice decor, good vibe and great food. The only issue that I wasn't too fond was when I asked for extra peanuts, I thought it would be in a small dish like I got from the bar. But NO, the waiter came out with a big bowl of peanuts which I didn't expect and he should've told me they charge $7 a bowl. The peanuts were stale and taste rancid. I felt ripped off. Read more The lunch menu is pretty limited compared to the dinner menu but the food was very good.
The portions are fairly small and the prices are relatively high.  The cook could not get my steak order cooked two pink and not bloody. The first time it was given to me it was well done and I returned it. The second time it was given to me, it was bloody and I sent it back. The hostess insisted on sending it back to the cook but by that time my companion had finished his meal and I had filled myself up on side dishes, so I refused it. My husband pointed out that through all the times the hostess was at the table, not once did she refill his empty water glass. The salmon that my husband had was good and he enjoyed it. I still ended up paying a lot of money for very little. I would not recommend this restaurant. Read more Le Parc Bistrobar is an exceptional dinner experience in San Francisco.

The service was impeccable, and the ambiance was both relaxing and informal, yet still elegant, making for a delightful dining experience. Our chef, Toulga (sp?), was exceptionally friendly and took the time to explain the intricate flavors of each dish.

Some of our favorites included the starter Zensai with Caviar, the melt-in-your-mouth Sashimi, and the Glazed Black Cod, which was pure bliss.

The room is a bit too loud; making conversation sometimes difficult.  And the front half of the space too dimly lit for my taste.  It was fantastic! And Diana our server was fabulous. Unfortunately I read the tab wrong. I short changed her on my tip. I’m sorry Diana!!  Food is good but pricey.  Service person would disappear and we would have to call her over.  It is really loud in there and could not hear each other.  Great meal, spotty service. We aren’t sure we actually had any one server.  My husband and I came to dine for our date night, and we had high expectations as we had heard good things. But the service was poor, when the server came to greet the table, he never introduced himself, didn’t even explain the menu dishes or anything. Through our dinner we saw our server maybe twice, and once when ordering our starters, he asked me how we wanted the dinner spaced, which I believe he should take care of, but of course I had to give him instructions, the other time he came over was when we ordered our mains with, and he ordered the wrong dishes for us. Not only did he mess up, he didn’t even come to the table after such, and told us near the end of our dinner that he was sorry we didn’t like the dish, which again just not taking accountability for mistakes. It was ridiculous, another young gentleman, took better care of us, asking us how our dinner was. Overall just had a bad experience, and would recommend maybe being more attentive. We left early because we were so disappointed. Read more Mikey the host was amazing and extremely helpful! Would go back again.  Blind Butcher is a must in San Francisco if you’re looking for attentive service, great atmosphere, and all around delicious dinner. Eye contact and acknowledgement from each employee was also a nice touch!  Very classy restaurant, perfect for date night or girls night out  Apps were fine but nothing to write home about. Ribeye + truffle mac was great, had bold flavors and was cooked well. Restaurants was a little too dark for me  Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and it was a vibe small spot but cute!

Honestly nice ambience but food is decent and took forever to come out. Perfect place for aesthetic pictures though if you’re into that.  After reading other reviews I was optimistic for this experience but unfortunately it turned out to very much be just a standard hotel restaurant with mediocre service at best and promising but not quite delivering food.

We stopped for a breakfast brunch on a Saturday morning while we had time to pass in the area. The initial server was less than helpful in even attempting to address a simple coffee request. (My dining mate actually went down the street and got the mocha they were seeking and brought it back.) The second sever who came over was a bit more welcoming and did check on us. When we asked for butter for the toast they brought a huge ramekin with enough butter for a loaf of bread, which we found odd.

She offered amazing recommendations and was ver attentive. I can’t wait to return. Good is inexpensive and the decor is stunning. I highly recommend for a date.

Who knew there was a quality neighborhood restaurant just a few blocks from our hotel and Moscone - Also, their happy hour was fantastic - since I am not a big drinker, the food selection was fabulous for me to concentrate on.

She asked if I wished to dine in the main section of the restaurant or if I would prefer a location that was less boisterous for easier conversation.  I found this to be quite thoughtful as a member of our party is hearing disadvantaged.  The waitstaff was timely, receptive and knowledgeable and the time between placing our orders (appetizers and entrées) and receiving them was very agreeable 15 minutes, tops).  My entrée was good (I had the rigatoni) but not great (the sauce was a tad watery and somewhat bland) but the appetizers were solid (fried calamari and a hummus plate) and were served within minutes of ordering.  My companions each had the house burger and said it was fine.  Overall, an enjoyable evening was had.  My only wish is that they’d bring back the Osso Buco (I’m dating myself!) as it was a phenomenal addition to the overall menu.  Otherwise, a return visit to The Fly Trap is in the cards!

Fine dining seems to have largely disappeared in SF, but Bombay Brasserie combined Indian & French cuisine with excellent service.  We weren’t rushed at all & the staff accommodated a very demanding guest with grace & professionalism.  We’ll definitely return!  Sometimes, the dishes are trying too hard to have French influence. They turn out confused. “Traditional” Indian dishes tasted way better. Very promising but needs a bit of editing and focus.  Exceptional. The food was excellent. We enjoyed every bite. The service was outstanding. We wanted for nothing and had a lovely time. The duck samosas, butter chicken, scallops, and crab soup were standouts, but everything we ordered for our party of five was delicious, fresh, and beautifully presented. Highly recommend for elegant dinner out.  Overall a very pleasant experience. Great food, not too oily. Excellent service and great ambience. Lucky to have them.

The food was outstanding as well. I cannot wait to visit Bombay Brasserie again. Really enjoyed our time at the restaurant.  Loved it here! They had the best Lobster Thermidor I have ever had, so creamy and perfectly cooked. I definitely recommend the espresso martini but my partner had the lemon drop and that was also amazing. It was the staff that really made the experience, they were so kind and ready to help us with any our questions.  Wonderful dining experience, can’t wait to return!  We were so excited to try this restaurant and it truly lived up to our expectations. The decor was elegant, which, when combined with the attentive staff, created a welcoming environment. The food was so incredible, I will be thinking about the salmon for a very long time.  I already can’t wait for my next visit!  The Tandoori Salmon and the Kerala Beef were the stars of the show. Will be back to try more of chef Thomas George’s creations.  Great Food , The service is still trying to get to speed. It was very slow and orders missed.

Server/host was nice.   Salads were good, entrees were passable….the special of halibut was not a very nice piece of fish…thin and therefore a little over cooked.  Carrots as a “roasted vegetable” were no where near cooked….and I like them on the undercooked side, but you need to be able to pierce them with a fork.

We would have gone somewhere else if it wasn’t so late.  The food was good, prices were fair given the location on Valencia but their online takeout menu had special items that weren't on their regular menu and the prices were also much more reasonable on their takeout menu. Service was really slow - ordered two entrees between myself and my partner and there was a 45 minute gap, it would've been really awkward if we weren't sharing the entrees and the first entree would've been cold had we waited for the second one to come out. Had the pork Katsu curry, duck confit and hamachi carpaccio. The hamachi carpaccio was made of thick fatty slices, it was delicious and pretty standard for hamachi carpaccio. The pork Katsu was nicely breaded and fried, had a chewy texture that reminded me of mochiko chicken. The curry also had a nice spice to it, but there was a lot more rice than curry. The duck confit took the longest to come out, and it was in a salad, didn't taste like it'd been slow cooked for 12 hours, honestly pretty plain tasting, would not order again.

They can do a much better job on the food!! For the price of an upscale restaurant, the food is at best average.  Having been born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, this place was a pleasant surprise.

But I thought on the pricey side with 15 dollar glass of white white. Dessert was okay but advertised marshmallow topping but none and they did not tell us. We noted. 
Also there is a sign that no split checks two cards max. What does that contradiction mean? 

Slow to get water to table and taking order and that was at 5:30. 

They have been open since January and they need to pick up their service and music volume and dessert to match the prices.

Bustling Hayes valley spot. Good food and decent service  Lovely, relaxing atmosphere, delicious food the happy hour specials before 6 PM are great to get the rock shrimp and the sake nigiri and elephant spritz. The manager was so lovely when she stopped by our table. Fantastic option for pre-performance at Ballet opera or symphony.  Sashimi was superb. In fact, most food we had was very good. The cucumber salad brought down the rating because it was so bad. It was overpowered with spicy hot, instead of the light taste one expects. 

Cocktails are misleading. They don't seem able to serve hard liquor (I couldn't get a gin martini) although they list some kind of Japanese gin on their cocktail menu. This should simply be made clearer. It didn't detract from the experience, but clarity is always a good thing. Read more I felt welcomed the moment I walked in the door. The host was kind enough to seat me before the rest of my party did arrive. Host was very knowledgeable of the menu and offered a few suggestions based on my admiration of one item on the special's menu. The fish was super fresh, flavorful and very tender. I loved the vast selection of dishes and found it hard to choose on just a few. There are many more items on the menu I would like to try. 

I loved every bite. I never felt rushed. I will definitely visit again when I am in the area. Read more We love love love Elephant Sushi! And a special shout out to the woman at the front who makes everyone feel like they are a friend, even on their first visit.  Exceptional for birthdays and dinner and everything in between  Took awhile for the host to seat us and we were at front door with 3 other parties. Only 1 bathroom so the wait was long. Nigiri was amazing. The fish on the rainbow rolls was just ok. Tempura vegetables a little undercooked.  Unfortunately, this restaurant is like wearing name brand clothing. Similar quality as low end knock offs but expensive. If you want good food don't come here, chefs have no idea what they are doing.  Soggy rolls, over seared sashimi that's mostly cooked. Bad cut. Like wtf  What an incredible experience I had at Elephant Sushi! The Sea Bass Sashimi was delectable and the Miso Black Cod was out of this world!

I had the Peruvian paella and it was served too hot to eat, but also had very little flavor.
We would go back again.  Food is always reliably food, but it is very loud indoors. The outdoor patio is a good alternative option.

Despite that, the service was quite slow-paced. We sat outdoors on the nice terrace.  We are vegetarian, and there were a few vegetarian options on the menu although they should have more.
We ordered two appetizers and shared the vegetarian paella. The sangria was very good. The appetizers took a long time to emerge.  Te Brussels sprouts were quite tasty but the fried artichokes were tasteless.  The paella, which is pricey, was skimpy and bland.  I can't figure out why they wouldn't add a little more bombs rice to as an inexpensive expand it. (In the case of their Paella de Verduras, that's all it would take to make a more generous portion, although it tasted like they might not have actually used bomba or calasparra rice). I make my own paella often ands teach a Paella-making class and would be happy to give them tips on improving the flavors.
The paella needed salt but there was none on our table and the server didn't return after delivering the paella to our table.  My husband had to eventually go inside to find someone to bring us salt.
When our check arrived we were surprised that there was a 20% tip already added in.  Since the service was subpar, we would have tipped less than that but who actually asks for the tip to be removed--that a very uncomfortable option.  We also waited a long time for our server to return to take our credit card.

One of my favorite places to go!  Excellent food & service. Very accommodating. Initially had reservations for outside (on the terrace/patio) but since it was cold that day and we had a baby with us, they seated us inside instead.  Food looks  better than it tastes. Music was super loud. I'd go again but probably get something else and not bring my girl friend because we had a hard time hearing eachother speak.  We love this place. I was a little disappointed that some of my cauliflower was burnt.  I was going to send it back but for the price we paid for it the cook should have never sent it out of the kitchen like that.  I was also a little shocked about the 20% gratuity that is automatically added on.  That should be up to the customer and not forced to give such a large tip. I have always felt 20% is for fine dining. Read more Food was extremely salty, service was slow and disorganized, and the tapas portion size has dwindled significantly for the price. I was looking forward to dinner, but will not be going back for a while!  Food was disappointing , won’t return or recommend.  Noise level is a bit loud dining in middle of dining room.

It's the bricks-and-mortar spin off of chef Francis Ang's pop-up Pinoy Heritage. The lively menu is split up into barbecue sticks, noodles and rice, and small to big plates, but its far more nuanced than just that. Flavourful dishes pull from family recipes and are glazed with modern and heritage technique to result in a vibrancy that's hard to come by. It's grounded by local produce. Smoked Bay scallops lead in the seafood pancit, heirloom tomatoes top homemade tinapay bread, chicken skin is glazed in an adobe before hitting the grill and guinea fowl comes slathered with peanut sauce. A truncated list of creative Southeast Asian libations bring it full circle – if you're on the terrace, cool off with the Baguio breeze slushy – a dreamy mix of pandan-infused vodka, coconut and strawberry.","Read more This is place is AMAZING.

Oysters were small, gritty, and expensive for the quality.  Smaller portions and bigger price.  The ambiance was harsher than before (lighting changed and it felt like last call at a bar).

Bon Apetit!"," We have eaten at Roja several times since the new owners are in place.  The food has been excellent.  We experienced balanced and big flavors in all the dishes.  The staff has been friendly and easy to work with and they paid attention to our table as needed. This is now my favorite restaurant in Los Altos.  Food was not good. Super disappointed. Maybe a bad days for them. But too many of our appetizers and meals were wrong or not right.  Food was good, service was outstanding! We'll be happy to come again  Wonderful experience!! Great food, good service and atmosphere. Really enjoyed our evening at Roja!  A excellent restaurant that never ceases to please us. The food, ambiance and service are excellent. Always a pleasure to dine at Roja (formerly Asa)  The food was not good. The only good dish we had was the potato terrine  The food was superior! Our lamb fell off the bone, appetizers were truly unique (cured trout stained red from beets and rolled into the shape of roses), and desserts with standout flavors.  My wife and I went here for our wedding anniversary, and unfortunately we were both somewhat disappointed, especially for the price-to-portion ratios. The food was good, but honestly it was nothing to rave about. We got the meatballs, ""prawns"", and cauliflower for apps. I say ""prawns"" because they were tiny lol. The meatballs and cauliflower were good, but again they were exceptionally tiny portions for the price. For our entrees, I had the Ravioli Carbonara (which should be labeled ""raviolo"", as there was only one, single raviolo on the plate...) which tasted great, but the portion was laughable. My wife got the Arrabiata, which was good, but the pasta was undercooked. We knew it would be expensive going into it, which wasn't the issue, we just assumed we were going to be wowed by the flavor experience that people raved about in the reviews. The service was decent, but not very warm and inviting. All in all, it was good, and I wouldn't write it off because I'm sure there are other things on the menu that are great (it was pretty packed), so take this with a grain of salt I guess. I just think we could have gotten a better meal for half the price elsewhere. Read more The food was good, but not great.  We ordered almost all of the small plates for a group of 4, so we got to try lots of things.  The shrimp was the most flavorful.  First time at Roja. It won’t be our last.

The menu is small but there were several specials offered. We started with the beet salad. It was excellent. I had the lamb osso buco. Wow super tender, excellent flavors. My wife had the roasted rock fish special. It was also good. The bread service was OK but $10 seems high for something that many places still offer complimentary. The wine by the glass selection was very good.

We will go back again and would recommend to anyone. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/66472502.webp

Thought it might be a bit more elegant. Still, served it’s purpose for a pre-theater (Orpheum) dinner.  Great downtime place, food and drinks were served very promptly and they were delicious  We selected Cable 55 for a pre-theater brunch, since it's about a half mile from the Orpheum Theater, and there are not a lot of other choices for Sunday matinees. We didn't realize that breakfast service ends at 10:30, and lunch service starts at 11:30. However, when we arrived shortly after 11:00am, the gentleman at the bar very kindly took care of us. He served us the sparkling wine we ordered, and even took our orders prior to the arrival of the scheduled server at 11:30. We really appreciated his help to make sure we had a pleasant experience. The lunch menu is a bit limited, but we all found something we liked, and everyone enjoyed their entree.  Prices were to be expected at a hotel in downtown San Francisco. The server knew that we were headed to the theater, so he provided prompt, but not rushed, service. The restrooms in the lobby were clean, and we made it to the Orpheum with time to spare.  We will likely return to Cable 55 for a future theater date. Read more Not as high end as was expected. Very much cafeteria feel. Sat in the comfy chairs with low cocktail tables.

Everything was fine but nothing stood out as amazing.  Está bonito el lugar, nos tocó cerrada la parte que tiene la vista a la plaza, pero fuera de eso todo muy bien, la comida fue buena y el servicio excelente.  Pretty casual.

Our favorite!!  Food was amazing but a bit pricey - appetizers: eggplant, tadziki, avolemono soup and beets; brussel sprouts, potatoes, french fries for side dish, Souvlaki and salad for lunch. Everything was delicious. Ambiance fantastic. Great for business lunch.  Love this place! Food, service and atmosphere! My fav restaurant in Burlingame!  The music was a little loud for us to talk but the environment was fun and the food delicious. We ordered souvlaki and lamb and had a variety of spreads (tzatziki and elios, which we HIGHLY recommend!). Pita was not super fresh but those spreads would’ve tasted good on anything.  As always, all dishes that we ordered were exceptional!   MY guests were very impressed with the freshness and quality of each dish.  The servers were very attentive and helpful.  Great service , great ambience . Fabulous for celebrations , ( not for first dates 😄) because of the noise . But overall , I love it ‘ specially the spicy 🌶️ Cadillac margaritas  It was great, but wish they would have brought something out for the birthday girl as it was noted in the reservation  Great dinner!

Highly recommend, and on a warm evening it's lovely to sit outside.  Inside is a bit too loud.  We were surprised at the quality of the dishes since the dishes and ambiance was more casual.  We have been to Spain and were pleasantly surprised to get good Spanish ham as it is rare to get anything decent in the US; it would have been nicer to see them slice it tableside but with the amount of tables and casual vibe I can see their reason but still like to see it being cut from the whole leg.

The best way to enjoy their food is only order their tapas which are great.  If you had a group of 4 or more then it would be great to split the 40oz tomahawk or one of their paella options; to me at least from visuals of other tables ordering mains, the tomahawk looked better.  The dishes are rich and you will find yourself pleased with their flavors and easily full with just tapas.  The price was very fair for the quality.  The do automatically put a 20% gratuity, FYI.  I would highly recommend the Iberico Spanish ham, the crab and ham croquettas, the artichoke hearts, and empanadas.  Their deserts are ok not stellar and I wish they offered the hot chocolate and make it super thick to hold up a spoon like you can only find in Spain.  They also have a gift shop to offer hot chocolate, chocolate, wine and other local items from Spain.

I have heard from trusted foodie friends that the Palo Alto is the original and best location as they have had their Tomahawk steak not cooked to the level of what they experienced in Palo Alto.

Service was great- we got seated right away even though we got there 10min early.
4 stars coz the person who brought our coffee seemed in a bad mood, the sangrias taste watered down, And the bathroom isn’t that clean.
Otherwise Teleferic still is one of my faves and has the best pulpo and paella Negra! Read more I have visited Telerific twice. The first time was good. I would say about half the dishes were okay and the other half were good. However, on my most recent visit, only the cauliflower dish was good. The squid ink paella did not have enough flavor (I recommend ordering the pork belly one instead, which was much more flavorful), and the chef's special (ahi tuna on eggplant) was just a weird combo. 

Be careful if you get seated outside. It took forever for our waiter to come and even offer water/drinks. I had to flag down a bus boy to get our waiter after waiting 10 minutes without having anyone check on us. It also took a long time to get our check and pay for it.

The chicken tatsuta-age was a standout dish, and the service throughout our meal was commendable. The staff was attentive and ensured our needs were met.

We understand that planning is overrated and spontaneity is the spice of life! That's why we always keep availability for walk-ins of groups of 2 or more. Simply walk in and our friendly team will be happy to accommodate you at the door. We now take limited reservations for groups of 2 or more. Please note that while reservations provide a guaranteed table, we strive to accommodate walk-ins as much as possible. Big groups, no problem!

Try it yourself-book your table or stop by today!," I was surprised and pleased at the quality of my food. I had a New York strip and this being a hotel restaurant generally they are not the best you have ever had. My steak came prepared absolutely perfectly and flavorful my meal was very enjoyable and the service was very good.  This ""restaurant"" is located in the center of the Embassy Suites lobby.
The food is fine, the atmosphere is a little bit awkward as people walk through the area all the time. Service is friendly and efficient.  Red Oak Craft Bar and Rostisserie is a hidden gem! The food is outstanding and many items come from their own garden. The salmon melted in my mouth and was served with their homemade pesto sauce. The food is farm fresh and delicious! Service was outstanding too. The atmosphere is very casual and welcomes all guests, not just those staying at the Embassy Suites.  The bartender/server was awesome. Food was great.  We should have known when we walked into this completely empty property on a Saturday night that this would not be a good experience. I had heard good things about this place & decided to give it a try with some Out of town friends.

The restaurant itself is very nicely appointed. A recent remodel has garnered sleek lines, comfortable seating & a spacious open feel. It’s really well done in terms of appearance.

They had an interesting signature cocktail menu so we decided to give these a go. Our server got my order wrong & brought me a cocktail that had an ingredient to which  I am allergic . I took one sip & knew it was the wrong drink. My friends Manhattan was delicious. When the correct drink finally arrived it was loaded with Cinnamon which was not mentioned as an ingredient. I am allergic to cinnamon as well so no drink for me.

In terms of food we started with “Loaded tots” which were dry, flavorless bits of potato with nothing loaded about them. We also had the caprese salad which was three pieces of mozzarella, four small pieces of tomato, & four pieces of basil slathered with an obviously store bought “basalmic” dressing. The salad looked ridiculous because it was served on a long white plate much too large for the amount of food.

For entrees a friend had the steak quesadilla which seemed fine. My other friend & I had the “rotisserie rib eye steak.”  This was served with inedible “mashed potatoes” which were a gluey, flavorless lump. Mashed potatoes are my favorite thing in the world so you know they are bad when I leave them virtually untouched. The ribeye was ordered medium rare & arrived at best at medium with a very uneven cook. Perhaps the chef wasn’t used to cooking on the rotisserie. Parts were literally burned. (I expected some char on the steak but this was ridiculous.). The steal was poorly, if at all seasoned. Included on the plate was some sautéed spinach which tasted bland.

All in all avoid  this place. It’s not worth the trip. Read more The food was okay, not the best selection and they were items that were publicized that were not there but at least it was edible. The biggest problem was the service which was awful. This was supposed to be a bottomless mimosa brunch for Mother’s Day, and we basically had to continuously flag down someone to help our table. The plates piled up on the tiny table that they put us at, and I had to bus my own table because nobody would come and clean off the plates. I would not recommend this spot and will not be returning. Read more Forever, so went for the Mother’s Day brunch buffet. It was great! It was a white Friday food. Everyone was satisfied.  Excellent buffet!  Large variety of food.  Excellent service.  It was a nice experience for Easter brunch. Food was just okay and need more seasoning.  Good variety of choices. Services were great and attentive.  Constant refill of water and beverages.  We came for the Easter brunch buffet for $49 per person. Service was excellent, the staff were friendly, and the space was bright and enjoyable to sit and have conversation. The food on the buffet was average, but plentiful. Excellent arugula & golden beet salad, fresh cut fruit, and cheese ravioli. The salmon was delicious and not over cooked in the chafer. Bacon was crispy and sausages were juicy.

They had a carving station for roast beef and ham, but I passed on that (ham looked overcooked and dry). They also had an area where they would serve eggs Benedict and omelettes to order. There was one lady who came up to complain that all the poached eggs on her eggs Benedict were poached hard and came back to get a couple replaced. She then cut them open after given some on new plates and they were all still poached hard. She then left the food there on the counter and walked away upset. I personally think if they had prepared the eggs Benedict and placed them on the buffet line that they would be better. I ordered an omelette and got an eggs Benedict to just try for myself. My omelette was fine, my eggs Benedict was just okay (egg was definitely poached hard like having a hard boiled egg). I ate 1/2 of it anyway.

Desserts were okay, we liked the Tiramisu cake the best.

It was quirky to have the bread toaster plugged in and available when there weren’t any sliced breads to toast, but only bread rolls were put out next to it. My roll was hard so I decided to put my bread roll onto the rolling conveyor belt of the toaster and a worker came up to me to tell me that the rolls aren’t meant for the toaster and it ended up getting stuck. He unplugged the toaster after that. Um, okay. When I took another one to take back with me to our table it was hard and very dry. Oh well. For our table for two gratuity was automatically added to our bill, but we didn’t mind that, the staff was excellent. We will find another spot for Easter brunch elsewhere in the future though.

Additionally, we had to continually ask the food runner to order whenever we wanted more food. We were continuously not checked in with to see we needed anything.

A spirited, bar-driven restaurant serving rustic Italian fare with modern sensibilities. Tratto means the stroke of a pen or a mark in Italian, nodding to both the neighborhood’s artistic history and the name of The Marker, the boutique hotel next door.

Tratto’s flavorful menu of simple, delicious and shareable dishes coupled with casual, communal-style dining creates a neighborhood bar experience inspired by the Italian tradition of “aperitivo,” or happy hour.

Guests can enjoy playful twists on classic Italian cocktails, boozy Italian sodas, and beer and wine from California and Italy, including a jug of house wine from the taps.

Choose from a wide selection of traditional small-plate antipasti, house-made pastas and pizzas, entrees served family-style, seasonal side dishes, and classic Italian desserts including ice creams, gelatos and sorbets.","Read more We went to a show at the Curran and came for dinner at Tratto afterwards.

We made reservations on a Friday, at 6 p.m. at Tratto as part of a pre-theatre dinner with friends. From the start, it was not good. Although the restaurant was what looked to be a normal dinner crowd, our server was clearly stressed and disorganized. It took almost 15 minutes for her to get to us, and then she wanted us to order immediately. When we asked for drinks, she told us it would be a while.. It took almost 30 minutes to get drinks. We were going to order wine, but we figured it would never arrive in time! We ordered an appetizer as well as a few entrées. Almost 40 minutes later, our server brought everything out at the same time. The appetizer had clearly been sitting somewhere for a while because it wasn't even warm. Highly disappointing. Also, the cocktails are so small. I ordered a double Grey Goose martini, and there is no way it was a double because the glass couldn't have been more than 3 ounces...and that was $30!! The manager ended up comping part of our meal since it was such a disaster, but even with that, it was not reasonable. Stay Clear.

Prix fixed menu is a bargain given the prices at other establishments. The zero corkage fee on Wednesdays will be something to try in the future. Since we were a group of five we did not mind the 2 hours for dinner as we had a lot of catching up to do, but I will say it took some time to get our food and drinks.

We had  their 3-course prix fixe meal which was delicious and at an incredible price of only $19.95.  Very pleasant and reasonable price- good street parking mid week or take the #5 bus  A birthday party for ten  youngish people definitely amped up the noise level! Next time I'll make an earlier reservation, i.e., before celebrants get too loud!  Service? What service? My first visit to this neighborhood fixture was disappointing and frustrating leaving me zero appetite for seconds.

Ambiance-wise, the restaurant is on the rundown side. It is warmly and softly lit for the most part. The vibe is casual, very chatty, and crowded.

The food was hit or miss with unusually small portion sizes across the board. The tomato soup was delicious, but the miserly portion size made it feel like a ripoff. While the entrees were more reasonably priced, the portions were small, and the shrimp risotto was too soupy. We had planned to get dessert.

The biggest problem for our party was the service—both in attentiveness and hospitality. The owner/server/host wasn’t very friendly or welcoming to our party of four from the moment we walked in. And he was the ONLY server taking care of all the restaurant’s dozen tables and several large parties in the restaurant. In his triaging of the dining room, we were left for dead. Everything from waiting to order food to getting our pasta dishes to getting the check took frustratingly long. We waited 20+ minutes just to get the check alone. The worst part is that we came in before the rush of the big parties.

This restaurant has seen better days, and it’s not the place to take a date or have a special dinner. Read more Clearly a well-known inexpensive place in the neighborhood, and while the food was okay, the service was terrible, crossing the border into actual rudeness. Menu was confusing and the conditions of the prix fixe special were not clear -- hence the disdain from our server. Go ahead and take your chances if you're looking for a bargain (sort of), but be prepared for uneven service quality and having the check literally tossed at you without any thought or a thank you. Will not return. Read more Fun bistro that just slightly missed the mark. Small plates, need more flavor. Drinks were good. Staff very friendly.  I had the chicken which was okay, not great. I wouldn't order it again. The seafood dishes looked great. Other guests looked like they enjoyed their meals. Only 1 server for the entire restaurant. She was wonderful and did her best, but it was slow.  We loved the grill so much last summer that we made sure we returned while in town this summer.  Honestly the waiter was just kind of a d!ck. Maybe he was just French and they can't help but be a-holes, but he was incredibly inattentive and almost seemed resentful/disdainful or some weird type of vibe. I'm truly not the type of person that typically complains about service; I understand it if someone didn't show up to work and you're busy, but he didn't even pretend to attend to us or ask us how we were doing unless we waved him down. Even then, it was very curt.

The food was pretty good and reasonably priced. It is also a cute space with a nice location near Alamo Square. I honestly would have given the restaurant five stars had the service not been so bad. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/62842277.webp

The bread was not that light crispy baguette that I remember and the Quiche was not as good as it was in the past. I will most likely not be returning to this restaurant☹️  Nice little place on Belden Lane. Food and service were good.  Another exceptional dining experience at Bastille. The mussels were sweet and delicious. Our server was attentive and delightful. Everything was just perfect for me and my friends.  I love this place’s ambiance and service. Unfortunately it’s not very authentic French. Baguette came with olive oil and vinegar (not butter) - More Italian than French. Salad Niçoise was mostly lettuce, and tuna, the rest of the ingredients were minimal. Also not authentic. ",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/31032254.webp

It felt like what would happen if a person from Hong Kong tried to make an American brunch place while on drugs, but then later insisted that all of the food actually be great. I expect to come back here.  Food was amazing! Service was great and drinks were very cute and yummy  Amazing cute food. Must go there. We all loved it.  The food was wonderfully prepared and presented--quite tasty.  The service was excellent.  Great food. Generous portions. Always a treat. I look forward to coming back and maybe trying their cocktail bar.  We had a wonderful experience! We had the tea on Sunday and returned on Monday for their regular menu options. The food is fresh and so good. The scones are amazing.  You should try their ""liquid breakfast"" special drinks; they have them without alcohol, too. 
That is an experience on its own; they are so creative. Read more It pains me to say this because Son & Garden is one of my favorite places to eat in SF (both for brunch and dinner), but the afternoon tea service disappointed me. I reserved the new Beauty & the Beast afternoon tea service for my birthday for my 5 friends and me this past Labor Day weekend. I had specified that my friend had a severe nut allergy in the notes. They had confirmed my reservation with me twice: one thru OpenTable and one by calling me the day before. When we arrived, they sat us immediately. The biscuits they served were warm and delicious, and each person got their own teapot and tea. The decor and aesthetics were so pretty and detailed.

However, when the pastries and sandwiches came out, it seemed like some of the pastries contained nuts and the server did not specify anything about the nut allergy mentioned in the reservation. My friend had to flag down a waiter and ask and at first they said they didn't know and would ask the chef. They left and didn't return so we had to ask someone else and they said that the chef confirmed all the desserts contained nuts. They did not offer any replacements. My friend could only eat the lower tier savory options and had to order a separate entree to eat (which she enjoyed). I understand the staff were busy but this did put a damper on the experience.

That incident aside, the sandwiches and samosa were delicious and we loved them. However most of the dessert options (other than the cheesecake and chocolate mousse tart) were dry and overly sweet. I felt that the overall price for what we got was expensive (it came out to about $75/pp including the mandatory large party tip) and I had wished we had came for their normal menu instead. I would recommend Son & Garden for their lunch and dinner menu but not for the tea experience unless you are only coming for the Instagram pictures and not for the food. Read more What a lovely spot! We did tea service with additional cocktails, and everything was so incredibly themed. I definitely recommend stopping by because the standard food also looked amazing!!!

The French onion soup was excellent and the tuna tartare is a generous portion so you can easily share. The steak frites dish is perfectly seasoned and paired with a lemony arugula salad.

Last night, we took a friend for her birthday and had a great time. Carlos took excellent care of us. Two of our three main dishes were excellent. My friend found the pasta in her linguine with prawns a little overcooked, although the prawns were big and tasty. The beef bourguignon and petrale sole were delicious. Don’t neglect ordering the bread and French butter which are yummy. And the best dessert in our opinion was the chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream and drizzled caramel sauce.

I like your banquettes, but not the one next to the kitchen.  It was too noisy in that location.  Very good and reliable.  Could use more comfortable chairs.  Well=crafted and prepared authentic french cuisine. Service is spotty especially when busy.  This is our third time dining at the petite left bank and dinner was exceptional. Service was spot on. Enjoyed our experience.  We enjoyed lunch at this darling cafe in Tiburon.  I felt like I was back in Paris!

The papardelle funghi was our favorite!  Incredible experience. The service, the food, the ambiance. I wish I could give this restaurant a 10/5 stars.  Had the prosciutto pinsa and the delicious Brussels sprout chips. Bottle of wine. Delicious.  Had an early dinner with family before seeing Dear San Francisco. We were seated upon arrival.  Staff was very attentive.  Food was average. There was nothing in the memorable in the sauces.  There was no point in booking a reservation as when we arrived we were told that “everyone has a table” and were told to sit at the bar to eat with three bar stools even though we were a party of four. We then finally got a table but outside under an extremely loud speaker and when we asked for it to be turned down, we were told no. The food was basic and not the best, the only positive thing about that restaurant was the location which is why it’s crowded, not because of the quality of food and service.

I would love to go back and try other items on the menu.  Went w/ some colleagues for a casual Italian in North Beach--primarily for the roman style pizza. Pizza was pretty good, would order again. Wine options were not good and some of our wine-by-the-glass we sent back because had been corked for too long. Meatballs were good, others had pasta which they all seemed to like.

Terrible, I made a reservation through Open Table, it was confirmed and then when I got there they said they were not taking customers that night as they had a tour group in.
I asked if we could do takeout and they said come back in 20 minutes, I gave them my number to call when ready, they never called, went back an hour later, was still not ready for another 10 minutes.

A type of food and atmosphere that is truly labour of love . Such love reflects  in its quality of food, care for tradition of freshness of ingredients locally available and creativity in presentation of such unique flavours.  In the spirit of authentic, the restaurant falls short on quality.

Will be back to check out their fall menu soon! Read more Komaaj Wine and Mazze Bar is a hidden gem that took me on an unforgettable culinary journey. The ambiance, filled with warm hospitality, made me feel right at home. The highlight of my visit was the Nazkhatoon, a smoky eggplant dip that perfectly balanced tangy and savory notes, taking me back to the flavors of my childhood.

The sour chicken stew was another standout dish, with its tender chicken cooked in a rich, tangy broth that had just the right amount of tartness. It was like tasting the comfort of home, one spoonful at a time.

And then there were the platters, each brimming with a variety of textures and flavors that felt like a celebration of Northern Iranian cuisine. Every bite was a delightful surprise, reminiscent of family gatherings and the cherished tastes of my youth.

We love this place! We come here for brunch when we go to Lesher Center. The food, drinks, and service are excellent.  The food was well seasoned. Ordered the lambshank and it was tender. The lambshank couldve used a bit more sauce and perhaps a different side dish other than rice. The moussaka was a small size but good although I prefer no potatoes to my moussaka. The lobster was good. Desserts are good for only 1 person. Not big enough to share but they were good.
The service is not good. I had a reservation and when I arrived we had to wait for 15 mins and the 1st host did not even check the seating. And they are strict with reservations! The menu just lists the entree name e.g Lamb Shank with no side dish description and the server did not ask us nor did he confirm what the side dish is so you don't know what you are getting. The waiters do not attend to you at all esp that we had a birthday to celebrate. Poor service.
We expected to have dinner at 7:30pm and with the menu, we expected to have a sit down dinner. But, it was already a club at 7pm with the bar the busiest and with a DJ playing at full blast volume. That is lovely if it was a bit later but Elia says this is a restaurant. They did not say this is a club. 
All in all, we did not get the experience of a birthday dinner because the waiters were getting orders like this is a club. Service was poor.

My friend had to tell him to give away her portion to my mother because she was literally not receiving anything. We ordered 2 benihanna trio and another plate of habachi scallops.

The dinner moved along at a comfortable pace.  In the past we have had to wait  Seemed like reservation didn’t matter. Very poor communication from the host stand(just tell us if you’re running behind) $17.50 for a Vodka soda?!  That was flat?! Not good Bartender was over whelmed. Food was ok. Server was great!  Benihana's has been around for years.  Not much for the show, seen it a million times, know the script.   But I choose the tableside show versus the quiet bar area (no reservations that side), where they also  serve food, because they fry the rice fresh tableside. In the  Bar area, they scoop pre-made fried rice, held in rice pot, but tends to get mushy.  Tableside,  little  heavy on salt, and with soy sauces,  you may want to tell them light on salt if you need.  Meat was excellent, lobster tail was slightly overcooked, but good.   Our server was excellent,  very accvomodsting/attentive.   Packed Saturday night. Read more 2 pm reservation called to see if we can come in sooner. No hesitation switched to 115 pm. Allen Host very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Irma Waitress great service. Leo Chef great company and fun. Food on point. All smiles from them. 5 stars for each.

Once we got to the table we waited an hour for our chef to come cook our food. They were short staffed and it showed in the wait times.  We sat at 620...by 640 we had drinks..by 7 we had soup.....after soup came our server dissappeared and we were ignored...no refills etc.... our chef came out....even after checking the order per person still missed making my fried rice....so that was another 15 extra minutes of him making 1 portion alone....my toddler who was unruly.due to the wait at this point then got sick from only having had apple juice up to this point... we had nobody help with any napkims.or anything...we FOUND a wet rag on top of a tray leaning on our dining wall(near the kitchen entrance) and cleaned up everything and then finally once we ate...our server magically appeared again and asked if we wanted birthday ice cream etc.... my family of 5 had had it at this point and we said no...just the check,we are out of here....sad because we have been going there for years and never have I been so disappointed after 2 HOURS of trying to have dinner Read more Our chef Bryan was great and our server was extremely personable and attentive.

Single malt Scotch was $30 and up!  Told them in the reservation and upon meeting the waiter that we had a birthday.   It was never mentioned the entire night.

Great small, focused menu.  First & prob last time!  Mistakenly Ordered 3 mushroom, mushy Brussel sprouts & 1 Rainbow carrot zucchini corn yummy but not worth $8 a piece!!
Can't take spicy & every sauce is stupidly spicy except chips & salsa.
More vegetarian options and be more flexible on 1-item substitutions. Read more The tacos were very good and we tried several: spicy shrimp, carne asada, carnitas, and Baja fish. The churros were underwhelming as the centers were still doughy. Margaritas were not rimmed with a coarse Margarita salt and it more resembled an iodized table salt. It was overpowering and too salty. If we come were to come again we would restrict the order to the tacos and maybe bottled beer. Read more Tacolicious is always a vibe.

I appreciate you offer sliced veggies to accompany guacamole. The quinoa bowl is my go-to dish - full of a variety of ingredients and complex flavors.

Everything!  From the time we sat down, it was over 2 hours till we left.  I don’t blame the server, but I feel the organization and, production of kitchen nerds improvement on getting the dish prepared quicker. The drinking room was not full either.  Disappointing. We’ve eaten at Paseo many times over the past few years and we really enjoyed the food and the service - creative and fresh California-Mediterranean.

Unfortunately there’s been a change in chefs and along with it a new menu which is frankly more in linewithwhat you’d find at a hotel or club. Very dull. Nothing that would make a client or your 13 year old uncomfortable.

Adding to the disappointment was the preparation. Both the pork chop and the (very expensive) wagyu steak were overdone, approaching dry. The pork chop and the accompanying veg were covered in a sweet sauce - any contrasting flavors were lost. The ceviche was flavorless, no citrus or heat. The scallops were okay. At least they weren’t overdone.

Service was decent, although the servers didn’t ask how we’d like our pork chop & steak prepared - we had to chase down the order and even then it was overcooked. Wine by the glass took over 10 minutes to arrive.  positives were the olive oil shortcake, the fries and the Parker house rolls

Please Please Please improve the menu and the preparation, Paseo is a wonderful space and deserves so much better Read more Consistently excellent cuisine. Warm, friendly atmosphere. And Maya provides exceptional service.  💕  We had a delightful experience at Paseo last night.  We had a 5:30pm reservation so the restaurant was not busy.

They weren't too loud at all, which was nice.  We were here for the Mill Valley Restaurant Rally. For the appetizer we had the panzanella salad which was rather disappointing because there was only one piece of bread in it. The flavor was good but I was looking for more bread. For the entree we shared the 2 scallops and the NY strip with salsa verde and potato. The strip was a bit too rare for me but the sauce and potato was good. My husband liked the tender beef. The dark chocolate budino was the highlight of the meal and I wished I could have licked the bowl! Our server was excellent and very friendly. He made it a very enjoyable meal. Read more We looked forward to celebrating our 42nd anniversary here, having never dined at Paseo before.
From start to finish, a disaster.!
We selected the pre-fix meal @$55 per person.
There are few entrees overall on the menu to choose from so we assumed the attention to detail would be there. Couldn’t be more wrong.
Our waitress stressed that we should definitely try their special house rolls in addition. “A crowd favorite, hot out of the oven.” They were just a step above storefront Hawaiian Rolls. A $10 disappointment.
1st course (only selection option) was a Panzanella salad, which took a half hour to arrive. Dressing very plain and croutons stale and tough. A half hour after that our entrees finally arrived. I was shocked to see my scallop dish had only 2 scallops on the plate. Even more shocked that the kitchen had taken one scallop and sliced it in half to give the appearance upon presentation that I had 2, when actually they gave me one scallop for a $55 dinner! My husband ordered the Wagu steak. He provided me half of his, feeling bad. It had a giant tough membrane running through it that I couldn’t cut. His vegetables were “tasteless”.
We rejected the dessert that came with the prefix meal because by this time the entire celebration was ruined. Our waitress was clearly overwhelmed and swamped, excusing the delay each time she zipped past us.
Never again! Read more We called from San Francisco to find out if they had baked oysters for our anniversary.
New person answers said they had the large , big bbq oysters. We cancelled the Buckhouse reservation/thru have the most awesome oysters bingo. !!
But Paseo said they had LARGE oysters.

Turns out they were a LARGE disappointment as they were tiny tiny.
Not either the price.
Tuna at $42 we had to send back because it was cold outside as well.
Not the best date. Good bread .

The service and food were outstanding - our waitress was incredible.  She knew the menu and the wine list very well.  Outdoor seating on an early fall night was perfect. We were probably a little boring as we both ordered the same thing - the saffron risotto with shrimp.  She provided excellent recommendations for items to try on our next visit.  She kept us on time so that we could walk to the theatre (parking is not easy in Mill Valley, and it's a great idea to park once and walk).

I do hope this restaurant is able to turn it around, as I love having Moroccan her in the Marina. We booked an 8:45 dinner, and on arrival, the restaurant was all but empty. They had turned on the floodlights over the main dining hall, as well as some bright fluorescent lights over the open kitchen area. This absolutely killed all the work they had done to create an ambiance for dining, as well as told us they were already closed for the night, despite our reservation. Service was curt, rushed, and we felt pressured at every turn to order, eat faster, pay our bill before we were finished. It was awful hospitality, and I have worked these jobs in my own life for years.

If the restaurant intends to close at 9pm, realistically, they should not accept reservations past 8pm, knowing the staff will be discreetly cleaning up (without flood lights or fluorescent lights on) in the background, but giving guests at least 2 hours to enjoy a meal, with good service.

Always fun to be there for Quiz Me BeBe One More Time 💕  Always a fun time when ""Quiz Me BeBe"" happens on Mondays.

The updated menu is appreciated, although an additional dessert choice would be great. The cookies are exceptionally sweet, but that's just an opinion/preference.

Kudos to the wonderful staff! Read more They have a great selection of brewed beverages (including kombucha). It is nice to sit outside on a good day but they don't have a setup to protect you from the wind or rain. Inside is spacious. Ordering is easy. Staff are nice, friendly, and check on you (even outside).

I just wish their food had been better. Waffle fries are fine, if pricey for what you get. The pretzel sticks are good but the cheese sauce is terrible - more like a thin dressing! A friend had warned me to not even try their spaetzle. I haven't tried the rest of the menu but people looked happier with what they had, than I was with what I had.

Compounded by having a two piece band playing rock music over dinner time. We had to yell in conversation to hear ourselves.
Choose a more subtle genre of dinner music.  Everyone loved the food.  Great value.  We'll be back.  The service was good, friendly staff, cozy place, not very comfortable temperature as windows and doors were open. The food was acceptable but unimpressive.

They were Miyagi Oysters, which I have had many times. It was the only disappointment in the food. They were served too warm, the taste was not what I expected, and the sauce was watery and tasteless. They also neglected to serve lemon or small forks for the three of us splitting the oysters.

Dunyā Restaurant has garnered local acclaim as a Mediterranean casual dining experience touched by the fusion of refined urban technique and culturally traditional flavors.

Offering fare inspired by fresh, local, and seasonal ingredients, Dunyā brings this same delicate balance to a new era of vibrant Mediterranean dishes in an industrial chic setting located in the heart of San Francisco’s Nob Hill District.

The décor captures the warmth and feel of Mediterranean hospitality, while a vast floor to ceiling array of local and imported wine bottles is illuminated by blown glass filament pendants, inviting guests to pull up a chair to the full service wine bar.","Read more Poor service and when they did attend Toni’s they were very rude and short with us and the attitude was condescending. Place was empty so it’s not like they were busy.  Had a fun dinner at the bar. Service and food were great. FYI their bar can only serve wine and beer but the selection for each worked out perfectly fine. I had the adana kabab abd my friend had the burger and both were fantastic. the burger is lamb/beef just like the adana kabab.  The meat platter was very dried and over cooked even though we asked for medium cook  Small but great place with good food options. No cocktails but decent selection of wines.  Happy I finally made it there and joined a regular guest  A nice addition to the neighborhood with healthy Mediterranean food.  The staff was very attentive during our visit.  I enjoyed the half chicken & the dolmas were excellent.  Will return  1st time there.  Small, casual restaurant with good food.  Local neighborhood .
The server was great with recommendations and  very attentive.  The hummus was extra flavorful and obviously a regulars favorite..  I’ll be interested in going again and trying more selections.  Looks like a great bar if you want that too.  Excellent and delicious! The staff was attentive and lovely and the food wonderful. It is also a cozy spot. Totally recommend !!  Perfect dining experience. Favourite SF dinner so far  This place was fine.  We were able to make a reservation which is nice.  The staff was friendly if not super attentive (we had to ask for the check).  The food was good and came quickly.  We ordered the Kale salad which was quite good and a good sharing size.  We also got the dolmades which were just average (not bad, but not a lot of flavor).  For our main meal we ordered the mixed grill which was a nice size to share.  Everything was cooked fine (the chicken was a little 'over') it just lacked flavor overall.  No idea if they have desserts because we weren't offered any and then we had to ask for the check and head out to our show.  The atmosphere was good (if a little dark), the food was fine, and the prices were decent.  If someone suggested we go there again I'd be fine with that, but I probably wouldn't recommend it since there are so many other options to try in SF (or even just on Polk street).

One of my favorite places!!  Best place to celebrate a 50-year-old friends reunion -- and no better way to do it. The caviar is just perfect -- ""so much tastier, and less salty, than the caviar we get in Europe"" as one in our group pointed out. The beautiful coupe glasses were the perfect ""icing on the cake"" -- we felt like Audrey Hepburn enjoying our champagne and caviar!  Great place to get you Caviar in the city.

Refreshing menu with interesting dishes, every one of them delicious, from a plate of fluffy little biscuits with honey butter, to peach and greens salad, to perfectly done salmon with bits of crunchy baby corn in a creamy sauce.  We also had a tender, moist chicken breast with enoki mushrooms that was very tasty, with a little crunch in the crust. 

Our server had a lovely way about her, with both professional distance, and warmth at the same time.  We let her know we had 2 hours before our event.  She paced our orders perfectly, giving us that sweet pause of anticipation between dishes, and a little time to savor our wine.

Overall a decent place but nothing special.  Sadly no dessert menu otherwise would have been 5 stars  They said food was an hour away so we left. It’s not really a restaurant…more like a bar.

The waitress was very good but the kitchen staff needs better time management -- the entrees are supposed to be coming at the same time. Sadly, I am not a fan anymore. Read more for a large group  I recommend Tomatina. Food was great and ambiance. Great for family bonding. Servers was awesome!~  Went at quiet early lunch; food was great and service attentive.  Location is great with easy on street parking.  Would definitely recommend and return.  Things got off to a rough start as staff wasn't watching the front and busy helping someone with takeout.   After waiting about five minutes, we were seated.  Menus were brought including the happy hour menu which only applies for Monday - Friday and we ate there on Saturday.  

I thought the menu was pretty limited for Italian food.  I expected more options than the basic meatballs and spaghetti and lasagna, etc.  Lots of options for pizza though. 

Once we were served, we never saw our server again until we flagged someone down to give us our checks.  

I chose this this place based upon the ratings on OpenTable which in retrospect, was a mistake.  I wouldn't go back.  Not because anything was bad, it was just ""meh"" and not worth going again. Read more It is the first time in Tomatina, one of the meals was very different from what it was in the photo and I did not like it  Our  first time at this restaurant and our waiter Giovanni was amazing, very attentitive.

The escargot was just horrible.   Although this place is under new ownership and a more French menu.   We have been in at least 5 or 6 times.   Every time we order the escargot and love it.   This time it was just horrible.   It lacked flavor, it was very dry and had little to garlic butter.  It was over cooked and rubber.

Service was attentive and we never felt rushed. Nice addition to our many local brunch spots.  My dining partners were very pleased with their seafood meals.

Would return to try other menu offerings.  This is my second visit and was excited to come back. My first visit was very good. The food seemed fresh and interesting. This time around the food was flat and bland. I started with a salad, which was pretty good. Good portion with good flavor profile. I had the steak and Frites. The steak was cooked well but lacked flavor. We had a side dish of cauliflower and squash, which was soft and terrible. We finished with a bread pudding that was bland and seemed to a bit microwaved so was extremely hot in the center. we started with a drink which was good but had very little alcohol in it. Wines by the glass are very expensive especially the reds. Our service was excellent however but overall it was a disappointment. Given  it was $124 per person it hardly seemed worth it. Not sure if I go back but if I did, I would stick with the starters. ￼ Read more Nice redux of the Catch location and menu. Cocktails are good and fast. Food is solid although nothing too far off the path. Everything seemed well cooked. Will go again.  Wonderful food served wonderfully.  Great people have taken over a favorite restaurant.

Thankfully the birthday person was very understanding but on such a special day it was unfortunate. At least we cancelled the original 9 person reservation.

Not giving it 5 stars because I exchanged the garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli which also had garlic to which I am allergic with sauteed vegetables,
There was a $4.00 ""change Fee"" that was never mentioned when the substitution was suggested by the waiter.

2- is there is the patron should be made aware and decide to proceed accordingly.

We had an 18 month old with us and our server went out of her way to keep him occupied with crayons and straws.  This restaurant is one of our favorites and lived up to its reputation.  Absolutely amazing dining experience all around and the most delicious food I have had in a long time.  Delicious food. Excellent service. Great value.

Who could ask for anything more?  I wish the side patio was open, but we enjoyed sitting outside in front. The food is very good, especially the appetizers.  They have best food in San Alsemo. Definitely try the house  baked focaccia, Hamachi poke, Eggplant fries, yogurt grilled chicken and wagyu bavette steak. The drinks are great too. We celebrated my wife’s birthday and she/we had a great time:) Thank you  Always love it here!
The lamb chops were wonderful!  Great fresh and healthy food, fantastic service, and an excellent value.  Always  positive experience while dining @ Insalata. Good food , great service , wonderful waitperson !  We had a wonderful meal. The caprese salad was unbelievable. The service by Courtney was exceptional.

We enjoyed our visit to Colombini Italian Cafe.  We arrived 2 ours before we were supposed to, and were graciously seated.  The restaurant is very small, but we enjoyed the cozy atmosphere.  Service was efficient and they let us enjoy our meals.  We shared a delicious caesar salad to start. For entrees, I had a puttenesca pasta and my husband the lasagne.

Highly Recommended  This was a neighborhood find and we're not from this neighborhood or city. Food was good, portions generous, service warm and attentive. It's an informal, unpretentious place similar to neighborhood spots in Italy. Be sure and order the housemade fresh pasta as we did.  Small place but awesome food. Recommend checking this spot out sometime.  Great food and great service.  Will recommend to others.  The puttenesca was excellent even though I am not into eggplants but the combo of anchovies was well done.  The calzone, calamari steak, and bolognese were also superb.

It’s such a fun beautiful venue, very loud and wonderful view. The service is impeccable and the seating very comfortable. My disappointment is that my favorite lobster sandwich comes alone on a big plate. The sides are beans, asparagus and fries but no fruit or salad option. I feel that for $32 the small sandwich should come at least with some small garnish.  Also the chocolate chip cookies are very dry. The Mulhuland salad is yummy. They need some sort of chocolate dessert on the menu. Read more Beautiful environment but the food was disappointing.  Would be great for a nice lunch ... but dinners were underwhelming.  Always excellent, but tonight, while our server was excellent, it took forever to get the food. Hoping this was just a one-time issue.  We had a very nice experience at RH rooftop restaurant.  My son especially loved the Bellini.  My grilled shrimp and vegetable salad was too salty.  Next time we come here I will ask for no added salt.  The service was excellent.

The food and the service were amazing and the ambience is on point! ￼  I waited a month for this reservation as I love and have been in Yountville a number of times.  They need to find new front of the house.  I called to let them know I was running late.. usually they are appreciative.  This one had no clue.

Then we sat down.. fifteen minutes to get a menu.  Another ten minutes to pour some wine because they don’t have a liquor license so no cocktails. Food is not timed.. normally I don’t care but for the prices and the size of our two person table… no.  See picture and of course these service personnel didn’t know to bring a smaller plate or wait.  Waitress was equally clueless.  Never came by and we had to flag her or wait for ten minutes every time we wanted to do things like order.  Never cleared our silverware as we hand to hand our plates to the person who overpopulated our table.  Waitress mumbled an ingenuine I’m sorry but as waitstaff at a high end restaurant you can do better to make it right.

We left at 830 pm and they had no plan for people who take the stairs to exit.  The cleaners told us to walk around the back.  Maybe they should have signs to inform what to do?

Please get your act together.  For these prices, you should be better.  We will save our visits for Yountville.  Stay away… and I never say that.

Food was ok.. but like most reviews… the fish was charred to carcinogenic levels.  wine was better.. stay away from the rose spritzer.  Way too much fine crushed ice.  Room was pretty but way too loud.  Outside is so much nicer. Read more Service is 1 star and food is 3 star. I let them know it was my wives birthday and surprisingly they didn’t even bring out a quick candle to acknowledge it. I just didn’t feel like spelling it out like I was in some fast food joint. The birthday didn’t feel special at all.

Also, terrible follow ups after the food was served. Waited on condiments for 20 mins after the food got served.

The ambiance and decor are 4 star. Their wine selection is good. Since we live close by - will return to this place for brunch - maybe it’s better? Read more The food was good. The service was barely adequate for the level I was expecting. Our server was nice, but slow to come by. She did not check on us really at all. She didn't seem to know basic etiquette — we ordered a bottle of wine and she didn't have us taste it before pouring it. We ordered a salad and entrees and the salad came out long after the entrees. I was expecting a fine dining Expereince. Instead I got a high priced, mediocre experience.

So we went for the music (our night was Ken Cook, soloing on piano), and luckily we found parking right across the street from the restaurant, only a block away from the Bay. 
We were taken to one of the tables in their back room, but I asked if we could be closer to the piano, and we ended up sitting at a table for two right by the entrance, which was fine with us (although someone more sensitive to outside temperatures might not have liked it; ours was a brisk fall evening). It felt a little cramped, but I managed to momentarily overcome my introversion to chat with the lady seated next to us, who was most pleasant. Almost all the patrons were actively listening to the music.
The authentically Italian food arrived quickly, and was beautifully prepared and delicious.

Absolutely loved the tasting menu!!  Ate outside which they have done a very good job in setting up.  Service was great.  The best were the Turkish ground beef dumplings and the lemon mashed potatoes.  We also had the artichokes with Shrimp.  The artichokes were excellent but the dish should have been at room temperature rather than so cold.  Bread was fabulous.  Fantastic Turkish food at it's BEST.
Even better than in Turkey.  The food is superb. In a few times that I've eaten there, I tried various things. Every item on the menu is so special. Service is fabulous. But I must say, ot is very loud and hard to talk as a result  The ambiance and food was great. We were however told three times by three different people that our time was up and someone else needed the table. It took away from the experience, especially since the service itself was very slow.  This restaurant is for a special night out - time to enjoy and celebrate, not just eat.  The food was amazing with many dishes to choose from and adventurous flavors (in their cocktails too!)
Very nice evening with friends!  Great Turkish varieties with good service. A bit pricey. The mediterranean fish varieties are great  Unbelievably good! Great service and great atmosphere too  Great atmosphere, service, and food. Worth the price! Make it a dinner date. ",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/54156918.webp

We enjoyed a gin cocktail and a beer.  Then ordered a steak and a salad with shrimp.    All very good.  Enjoyed the eclectic music, not too loud. Also took the chocolate dessert home.  It was about $60pp.  Glad to try this new Cooperage location.  They have a nice private room that can seat 35 people. Read more Perfect lunch.  Perfectly shaved and cooked Brussel sprouts.  Followed by a perfect burger and onion rings. And a Nicoise Salad.  Perfect.
All complimented by perfect, friendly superior service!  My dining companion's food was excellent and mine was pretty good.  My entree was sitting in a pool of liquid (water/grease/a combination of the two?).  It was the same great-tasting eggplant parmesan I have at Cooperage before in Lafayette.  I did drain off this liquid before eating it.  It was lukewarm with some parts of it actually cold as if it had been hastily microwaved before serving it.

Mostly I felt some of the service needed some polishing up.  Two very pleasant men waited on us. 
I received a beet salad on a large rectangular platter but no utensil to scoop it on to another plate and no other plates for this but the small bread plates already on the table.  The salad platter and small plates we used to eat it were not promptly removed when we were done with them.   There was no salt and pepper on the table and I noticed none on the other tables.  If the restaurant does this for a reason I would be curious to know about it.  Generally, I like to have the option of adding this  at times.

As I said, the staff was very nice all around but some of these details would make for a better experience.

Thanks Read more Excellent food & drinks, plus a fun atmosphere. We’re quickly moving it from “somewhere to try” to “regular haunt”  One of our favorite spots to eat in Walnutcreek. We come here probably 3 or 4 times a month. Kid and dog friendly. Good selection of food and always yummy. I’d say the best hamburger in WC!  Great good; fabulous service; it was a little loud and difficult to have a conversation within our party of 7 people.  Perfect in every respect, from seating through leaving. Enjoyed conversation over lunch for nearly 3 hours without any pressure to complete our meal.  We had a great experience, the service was excellent and the food was very good.  Went here to celebrate an accomplishment by one of our family members. This was a Sunday for dinner. The restaurant was quite empty, but food service was a very slow regardless. We ordered three filet mignon steaks and a fish and they came out very slow. The cook on the fillets was good/as requested, and the cook on the Seabass was very delicious. However, the spinach that came with the Seabass had way too much garlic. We saw another table of two be seated at the same time as us get served their food and plates cleared before we got our main dishes. Additionally one of us was more hungry and we ordered a fourth steak, and we ordered it medium, but it was delivered to us rare. We returned it and asked for it to be cooked a little longer and it took about 15 to 20 minutes for it to come back and then it was cooked well done. For as much money we paid for all the steaks, this was very bad service, especially in the kitchen.￼ I find the cooking in the kitchen and the mistakes that occur in their often drive bad experiences at restaurants. The host/manager did try to repair the situation, but we were not interested in a free dessert to compensate for the poorly cooked steak. This restaurant really needs to get its service levels better because it is so slow and I read those reviews from other people that ate there previously. Not sure if I’ll come again due to the mediocre food and the slow food service. Sad because this location is a great location for restaurants if someone can get the service right. ￼ Read more We made last minute reservations, so we had to sit in the bar area. The service isn’t as good there. Are serving (Javier) was great, but seemed overwhelmed by all the tables he was expected to service. The food was good, but my seabass was a bit undercooked.

As a sharp contrast to fine Italian dining, this is a place to enjoy a glass of wine and unwind with unpretentious pasta dishes served in hearty portions. Tomatina is designed to appeal to as many people as possible, which is why they carry a vegetarian, gluten-free and children's menu in addition to their regular ones. Each month, Tomatina offers seasonal specials in addition to the normal menu. Staples of the menu that guests can always count on are dishes such as the mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich, ravioli di formaggi, mini-hand tossed pizzas.","Read more It was our first time. Like the menu . Everything went well.  Food and service was great ! Ordered appetizers and main dishes and everything was good  Food was good, since you order on your phone and pay with your phone they only had two people there to help you. So it took forever to get a refill on water or a take home box. The one person there had her favorites on who she preferred to help.  The service was not good for the cost of the food. Maybe bring down your prices  if you don’t want to offer a full dinning experience Read more Had a good table.  Server was very good.  Food quality was average but served promptly.  Price as reasonable.  Good ambiance and quiet.  Good experience!  Great food, both the chicken marsala and the roasted salmon were very good, as well as the bruschetta. Thanks!  There is no real wait staff, there are only food runners.  They are doing a roaring to-go trade, which is wonderful, but as a result you will essentially order for yourself via your mobile device and you should expect everything to come out as it is prepared rather than as intended.  Entrees arrive before appetizers, food is not brought out together but instead everyone gets served ad-hoc.  The TVs are all going and it's a sports-bar atmosphere.  Wait staff check in on you but they are not able to do anything to mediate issues...so it's a useless gesture.  Totally fine for a sports-bar situation where you are just chatting and drinking and eating sharable plates but it is no longer somewhere I would go for a nice family meal. It's difficult to hear amid the shouts of the sports fans, and the self-serve feel is not what I want when I'm dining out at a sit-down restaurant.

- Started off bad when they CANCELED my reservation instead of checking me in so I had to justify with OpenTable I was actually there
- Our waiter was focusing on servicing other tables and ignored us, I had to go find him to ask for take out boxes and check. He only came to take our orders and disappeared the rest of the time.

Highly recommend for the ambience, food and vibes Read more Sunny side eggs were scrambled. Service is slow. Music selection was fast dance music which did not match the vibe of the restaurant.  Been to Flores 3X before, all three were at lunch, first time for dinner and first time outdoors.  Outdoor seating was a huge mistake.  It’s not covered and it’s windy (menus, napkins would blow away if you did not weigh them down) and shady/cold.  We immediately asked if we could go inside and were told “no”.  Our seat was jammed between outdoor umbrellas so neither of us could move, chest was nearly touching the table, when I got up to push the umbrella back to make more space staff just watched, but offered no assistance.  We waited for 15 minutes before anyone came to give us a menu, which felt long in cold.  There was a couple in front of us already eating, the female looked miserable and asked staff if they could turn on a heating lamp.  The staff member told her “we don’t do that here”.  There were unused heating lamps all over the outdoor area including one that was 4 feet away from the couple.  We tried to order the fundita appetizer without mushrooms, we had done this multiple times previously but we were told they cannot prepare it that way as it was prepared and already “mixed in”, which we knew was not true.  At this point being cold, jammed into a tiny space and the restaurant being unwilling to accommodate any and every request we left.  This is not an inexpensive restaurant, food quality is good - but good food  without equally good experience/comfort makes a poor meal.

We also ordered the Halibut and the New York steaks and they were delicious. The portions were big but I managed to finish my steak. It came with broccolini, roasted potatoes, and chimichurri sauce. The halibut was done to perfection, and my husband, a fish 'snob', ate every morsel on his plate.

The owners stopped by our table to see if we were happy.  Good food, good ambiance (outdoors) and great attentive service  Food was great! Really enjoyed everything, especially the tacos. We had to wait a long time to order and get water, though (with spicy salsa on our tongues). Also, we were celebrating my husband’s birthday and it was never acknowledged even though I noted it in the reservation. Not sure if that’s the restaurant’s fault or opentable’s though.  The food was good, I had two spicy margaritas and felt like it was mostly ice and not spicy at all. I also don’t think there was much tequila in them- next time I may have to ask for the tequila on the side ! 🙈 it’s frustrating because they are like 15 a piece.  This is the first time we ate inside. The weather was too hot to sit outside. Very comfortable. Good was great as was the specialty cocktail. We love coming to this restaurant.  This is our go to Mexican restaurant in the tri Valley. The food is incredible. The margaritas are incredible and the staff is amazing. A side note, the restaurant has the most beautiful women working for them that I’ve ever seen. From the bartender, to the waiting staff, to the hostess. It’s like being in a modeling studio.

The food was average and the service (except for our hostess) was below average. Not sure if we would be going there again.  We have been here before and have enjoyed it, but oddly this time wasn’t as good. Outside seating, the music was super loud and we were fortunately able to get them to lower it. Then the beer came out, and it was warm. We decided at that point to call it quits and try somewhere else. We may give it a go another evening.

The atmosphere was perfect for a productive and enjoyable meeting. The food was outstanding. We ordered a variety of dishes, including drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts, and everything was delicious.

The short rib empanadas and ceviche were particularly memorable. The lomo saltado was cooked to perfection with a generous portion. We also loved the churros and chocolate mousse for dessert. The mousse was a bit thicker than usual, but it was very smooth and I actually preferred it to other places.

The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. It was a Monday, so the restaurant wasn't too crowded. I think this hidden gem is still relatively unknown. Even my clients, who work nearby, had never heard of it. They were thrilled to discover this great spot.

I will definitely bring my clients back here again and recommend it to others. Read more We needed a gem restaurant close to SFO hotel where friends flew in from Boston. Chico Marx (cool name) was it. We enjoyed multiple veggie, fish and beef dishes truly feeling like South American cuisine. Happy hour prices until 6:30pm on a Friday eve made this high value. Ambience feels like a modern library on the left, fun kitchen on the right.  A group of former colleagues were getting together for drinks and appetizers (Happy Hour) from 5-7 on a weeknight.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  They approached us immediately and directed us thoughtfully.  We had an assortment of small bites that were absolutely delicious.  We shared carafes of red sangria which was also perfect.  There were very few people in the restaurant at this time.  It was nice for our purposes to be in a quiet environment so our larger group could hear across the table.  The Happy Hour deals were very well priced.

This place is perfect for happy hour, hanging out with friends, or catching up with family.

The lomo saltado is definitely my favorite; the flavors are amazing. I've also enjoyed most of the food items on the happy hour menu. The cocktails are great, though I found the sangria carafe a bit watered down on my first visit. Other than that, everything else has been fantastic. The service is excellent, and the vibes are just right.

Once ordered, items came quickly but no other service provided throughout the meal. Pay on line and leave. Only 2 points of contact—seating you at the table and bringing food to the table.

The beer, food, service and location are top notch!  It is self order from your phone and it’s a hassle! We were a group and had to order as a group and although everybody can order from your individual phone, it is just a big pain!
When the staff brought the food in the beer, they were great, but I’m not sure why they can’t just hire a person to take the orders and offer personal service. Some people ordered things by mistake.

Asked for drink refills & either didn't get or had to ask multiple times. Asked for mayo chipotle sauce for fries.  Didn't get till 2nd ask & by then not many fries left. Why do they serve the sauce sometimes but not always??  The waitress said her manager removed the one dinner from the bill &  gave us check.  HELLO it was a birthday we wanted dessert.

Then walked back to hostess as nobody came to pick it up. At least I told her then about the poor service.   As for our food, sub par at best tonight. Really was a disappointment.  Never had the fried chicken before and will not again. It had no taste to it at all. It was a shame. Wings came with wrong dressing. Another entree came with cheese when no cheese was asked.

We love Ginji and have been going there for years, since they first opened. We went often enough that we knew all the staff. Now with the scan code menu, it is convenient but not as personable as it once was. The food is still great!  Loved the Izakaya stile dishes and taste good, Sapporo draft beer goes with food  Food was delicious! I recommend ordering the fried rice ball (off menu).  Still one of the best most authentic Japanese Izakaya places in town. They use genuine binchotan charcoal to grill their skewers and the flavors pop better than other Izakayas.

The portions were small and nothing to write home about
Tasked like taqueria food

Staff was helpful
We sat out side which is next to a weed store
So the ongoing crowd was not the best Read more The ingredients in the food were fresh and good quality but the overall taste was just okay and the dishes were definitely not what one would expect from a Mexican restaurant. At best, I’d call it Mexican / Italian fusion. The dishes were bland and lacked spice. The salsas were super mild and the guacamole had some unusual cheese cubes in it. I ordered the recommended main dish. I got a seafood angel hair pasta with a heavy cream tomato sauce. The seafood tasted fresh but I didn’t care for the dish overall; perhaps it was because of the heavy cream and because I was not in the mood for Italian and expected Mexican.   The server was pleasant; the prices were average for the Bay Area. Read more Food is so good! Love that you can go dressed up or causal.  As always La Viga food, drinks and service were fantastic. Some dishes are quite spicy so make sure to check if that is a concern.  We were a party of 6 and ordered a variety of dishes from coconut shrimp to enchiladas to tacos to mahi mahi and guacamole and chips as an appetizer. The food was delicious and the quantity was generous.
Everything was served in a timely manner, and the service was terrific. Will definitely come back to La Viga.  Food was great! The calamari was delicious!! We had the empanadas, tacos and several other dishes!  We loved that the menu was different. Our table got the mahi and the seafood enchiladas. They were both delicious! The chips, salsa, and guacamole were wonderful. The only thing I would ask is that the alcoholic drinks were a little stronger lol
Had a great time! Also loved the bread pudding for dessert  Used to be my favorite restaurant in Redwood City. Food was always fresh with excellent service in a fun downtown environment. Lots has changed since I was last there. Looks like the chef is no longer there as the the food now has the heavy hand of the chef from their sister restaurant LV Mar downtown.  On this recent visit ceviche was sweet, cochinita pibil was dry, and the mariscos were dismal.  Even the serving dishes are smaller and difficult to share.

Add to this, the restaurant was short-staffed, and our server was completely checked out. I'm not sure what happened to this Redwood City gem, but I'll be hard pressed to return. Read more I had a nice dinner; the food was excellent, and the staff was nice and very helpful.  The food at La Viga is excellent, but they really ought to consider changing up their menu. They've been serving the exact same choices for a few years now. Also, they might benefit from hanging some rugs or other sound-absorbing materials on the walls, because the place gets too cramped and noisy to hold a moderate-level concentration, so tables tend to shout over one another.

Really an enjoyable meal.  The place has a such good vibe, and the staff were on point - friendly and helpful without being over the top.  

Pasta Moon really delivers on their food!
Starting with their cocktails (El Vago) - they hit the spot! Then we tried the bone marrow Agnolotti - flavor town! The real standout? The ribeye steaks. We got four of them, and they nailed it on the cooking.

Pasta Moon gets it right with the mix of good food, solid service, and a nice setting. If you're in Half Moon Bay and looking for a classy, reliable dinner spot, I'd say definitely give this place a try! Make sure to place a reservation early on, because this place gets packed fast.

Great food and friendly bartender. Need better signage to attract more customers.  Best BBQ i’ve had in a long time The “Smoke Buddy” is a more than enough for 2 people and you get to get a taste of almost everything!  Such great service and food. Ambiance and noise level is an outlier I’m sure, as they were hosting an event half of the restaurant. Will def come back when I want a great bbq fix in the neighborhood.  Friendly staff. Fast serviced. All meat tastes  a bit too much like smoke.  Overall the food we ordered was good. My brisket was cold, my wife's rib tips were dry.  Solid BBQ pork ribs and potato salad. Brisket sandwich was good, but the meat was sliced so thick it was difficult to eat.  Sauces we all served on the side, which was preferable.  Ample beer and other beverages.

We’re so glad we found a new local favorite! Read more We thoroughly enjoyed the home made food here. My husband really liked the Tandoori chicken. The tamarind sauce was especially good. The desserts were enjoyable. I had cream whipped with lemon that in the UK we call syllabub. My husband had a cheescake.

Sole Meunière was just ok.  Probably purchased frozen and not prepared properly.
Service was quick and friendly.  Great find in the Financial District. Sunday brunch was an awesome time to go...quieter vibe and easy parking. Nice informative staff, full bar with imaginative cocktails, great fish and chips.  Their cioppino was excellent!  Personally I like cioppino without crab-in-the-shell. Unfortunately they don't have a lot of fish selections.  The food was less than desirable. The plates didn’t come out at the same time with at least 5-10 minutes between plates arriving. There was only 5 of us there.  We had four dinners that came with mashed potatoes and the potatoes were all cold. The first two plates came out and the potatoes were cold. We sent those back and asked for them to be fixed. They brought them back before any other plates were brought to the table and still cold potatoes. The next two plates came out again one with cold potatoes despite having sent the previous ones back for the same thing twice. The Sole plate came out last nearly 10 minutes after the rest and the fish was burnt and the potatoes yet again still cold. Was sent back and returned with another burnt piece of fish and cold potatoes. Was unfortunate the best thing we got was the French fries. But the rest was definitely not worth the price. The steak was tough and the bone in the pork chop was nearly half of the actual pork chop. More bone than meat. Although the waiter was helpful and tried to correct the problems the kitchen still sent cold food and burnt food out multiple times. Read more Horrible service from both bartenders. Will never be back even though the establishment has a beautiful decor and atmosphere  Good bar food, excellent service but not particularly memorable.  Cioppino was good but very salty.

Extremely disappointed with this restaurant. No one greeted us when we entered. Decided to sit at the bar, took 15 minutes to order a drink and 30 mins to order food. Ordering a second drink for myself and girlfriend was only successful after asking multiple times. The icing on the cake was when the check came and we were over charged by $80 for food and drink we did not order. We had to send back the bill 3 TIMES FOR THEM TO CORRECT.

A local gem! Read more Great food, excellent choice and good quality ingredients.  The shrimp entree had 4 small shrimp in the shell and tons of beans. It was barely any food and the menu does not indicate the shrimp are in the shell. Very disappointed  Poor service

Food was less than worth it! Read more We began our meal with the Warm Cast-Iron Buttermilk Cornbread and the Stracciatella. For the mains, we ordered the American Wagyu Cheeseburger, the Slow-Cooked Liberty Duck Panzotti, and the Gold Die Mezze Rigatoni.

Unfortunately, the overall experience was underwhelming. Both the food and drinks were mediocre, lacking the flavor and depth you’d expect from a restaurant that emphasizes farm-to-table, local, organic, and sustainable ingredients. The cheeseburger stood out as the best dish. The rigatoni was overcooked and bland, while the duck was just okay.

Adding to the disappointment, there was food left under our table and a noticeable trail of ants. The side patio had no ambiance to speak of. Sadly, this isn't a place we’ll be revisiting. Read more Another incredible meal at Camper! We started with the always delicious cornbread and added the stratchiatella with peaches, apricots and ham. This was so summery and tasty! For entrees, 2 of us had the halibut which was cooked perfectly with an incredible sauce, and I had the corn agnolotti… a summer staple that I adore. We also couldn’t resist trying a new item on the menu; their chicken breast. So juicy and tender; I would definitely order it again! Service was fantastic and friendly and once again, we left smiling after a great evening. Read more Enjoyed two nice pasta dishes, fusilli with clams, and one with duck confit. Service was excellent, with knowledgeable staff. Tasted wines before ordering by the glass. Generous pours both.
Highly recommended.  22% service charge included was surprising.  But great experience.  Great food & staff.

Update: Impressed with the team taking the time to respond.  IMO, the service charge is totally worth it.  (Hopefully others won’t be surprised with the charge and even if they are we hope they understand and look past it.)

Very excellent food, full of flavor, with great technical execution on everything we had. Drinks were also fantastic  Best bistro around Union Square, excellent food and service.  Our second time dining here and we loved it just as much… so we will return. We started with Monk’s cocktails, which was excellent. Also excellent were the fish crudo, octopus salad, skate, and seafood risotto. Our server (Darrel?) was the same as last time. Very knowledgeable of food and their menu. Others on the service staff were lovely as well.  Lovely place with a great Somm and servers. Delicious food! Good doorman who was helpful as we left.  Don't let the word ""Bistro"" in the name fool you.  This is a genuine fine dining restaurant, but at a substantially lower price point than the top tier.  Service was excellent, food was excellent and interesting.  Still expensive compared to what you may imagine when you see the word ""Bistro,"" but it has a much more upscale experience to match.  My second time visiting this establishment, the first being at the upstairs higher-end O restaurant and this time at the Bistro. Both experiences provided a very delightful meal but served with quite a bewildering service experience. Everyone we encountered in both experiences was as friendly as they could be but very much lacking in the details.

Just a few examples from my recent visit to the Bistro. Firstly, at the bar we had friendly experience with a cocktail suggested by the very lovely bartender. The drink was perfect, but was placed in front of us for a few minutes out of our reach while the bartender explained to someone behind a doorway that they were busy. After being seated by a host and no further greeting for approximately 15 minutes, our first contact with our server was being asked if we were ready to order. No water or drinks were offered until we asked. There was also some confusion with the a la carte vs. the course menus with conflicting pricing and extras. At one point we had three pieces of paper in our hands wondering what each was for. Further, the clearing of drinkware and plates were a bit ill-timed and erratic.

It was not a horrible experience. The restaurant is beautiful and seems to have a whole lot going in its favor. But for the price point and seeming intended experience, there are details that are in dire need of some polish. Read more This is our second time dining at ONE65 Bistro. The restaurant offers a charming and cozy atmosphere, along with excellent food and friendly, attentive service. Overall, it was a great experience! We will definitely come back again.  Good experience right from being welcomed upon entering the building up to the moment we left. Food was at par with our expectation.

I was embarrassed I chose the restaurant.  Wine bottle value was good. Food was fine, but overshadowed by the service.  The food didn’t taste great. I’ve come to expect higher quality cuisine from comparable SF restaurants  Sent a few team members here for dinner after a business meeting. The food was delicious, the wine was even better :)  Great unique restaurant and bar, I had the tasting menu and it was fantastic. It was a 3 course menu and the portions were huge  Great for a business dinner with my sales team. Good food  Delicious food, but service was a bit slow and I think we were forgotten about.  Sub-par. Unfortunately, wasn't very impressed. Service was slllloooowwwww - took a while for the server to take our drink order, and then took a really long time to have our plates cleared and our bill delivered. Wine was good but the cocktails didn't taste good. Apps were alright. Entrees were better but not great. Our server disappeared for about an hour and the runner had to jump in to serve our entrees and clear our table. 

Paid $30 dollars for the tiniest cheese/charcuterie board. I expected a little more variety of cheese - got a few cubes of blue cheese & provolone. Sliced apple (less than a whole), a few nuts and olives, and very few slices of prosciutto & mortadella. Not what you would expect for a charcuterie board, let's just put it that way.

Got the braised duck to share. Flavorful but a bit dry. 

Our entrees got screwed up so our table wasn't able to eat at the same time. After a very long wait. We were there for almost 3 hours, not by choice. 

We didn't go on a busy night. Complete opposite experience of when we had a private event in their Speakeasy downstairs. Read more Awesome place, can’t recommend it enough. I feel like it gets overlooked because it’s in FiDi and that part of town tends to clear out after the workday is over, but eating/drinking there is a real treat and deserves more patrons!

Thought it might be a bit more elegant. Still, served it’s purpose for a pre-theater (Orpheum) dinner.  Great downtime place, food and drinks were served very promptly and they were delicious  We selected Cable 55 for a pre-theater brunch, since it's about a half mile from the Orpheum Theater, and there are not a lot of other choices for Sunday matinees. We didn't realize that breakfast service ends at 10:30, and lunch service starts at 11:30. However, when we arrived shortly after 11:00am, the gentleman at the bar very kindly took care of us. He served us the sparkling wine we ordered, and even took our orders prior to the arrival of the scheduled server at 11:30. We really appreciated his help to make sure we had a pleasant experience. The lunch menu is a bit limited, but we all found something we liked, and everyone enjoyed their entree.  Prices were to be expected at a hotel in downtown San Francisco. The server knew that we were headed to the theater, so he provided prompt, but not rushed, service. The restrooms in the lobby were clean, and we made it to the Orpheum with time to spare.

Taverna co-founders Thanasis Pashalidis and Hakan Bala were raised with a shared ethical compass, which the Greeks call ""philotimo"" or ""love of honor"". Family and friends are their ingredients of life, and they believe that nutrition, happiness and health are all directly correlated. Both partners have been culturally influenced by the remedies of the old world and incorporate them into the lifestyle of Taverna. Both have an ""ethos"" that drives them and inspires others to live fully, which they consider the flavor of life's success. They understand that life is to be enjoyed and that time is of the essence. They are aware that every day is a gift.

Taverna has been created to make people happy and feel alive.","Read more Taverna has exceptional food, great ambience, and welcoming staff. Love this restaurant. Have been many times - and will continue to keep this on my list of top restaurants in the Bay Area. Love, love, love it. Try the chicken skewers, they will not disappoint!  Best Greek Cuisine in the Bay Area (SF not included).

The food is very good – Greek tradition, but adjusted to local tastes. Our favorites are the steak (ask the chef for it, as it’s not on the menu) and octopus. Saganaki and spanakopita are authentic.

The desserts are mind-blowing, so don’t skip them! Try the BOUGATSA with pistachio ice cream and SOKOLATINA—a combination of flavors and textures! I’ve never had anything as great, even in Greece.

The wine list is diverse but too long (out of curiosity – 11 pages!).

The team is very friendly and resourceful. The place is kid-friendly, and the guests are great, all together creating a cozy atmosphere that’s close to a fine-dining experience.

My “two cents” for a perfect 5-star experience would be to include a classic meze plate to share on the menu and to redesign the wine list. It could benefit from a more thoughtful selection—perhaps shorter but more sophisticated—along with an expanded choice of bubbles! Read more We had a fantastic meal at Taverna. The servers were attentive and friendly, and made excellent suggestions. We would definitely go back!  Great food but nonexistent service. Had a chipped water glass. Once our main courses arrived no one revisited our table to even refill our water glasses. By the time we were finished there were only 2 other occupied tables in the room and yet we still had no refills and had to seek out the check ourselves.  The food is good, but not as authentically Greek as it needs to be. The Retsina wine does not have a very strong resin taste - I was glad the waiter let me taste it. So I had Ouzo instead and tipped my water into it, as Greeks might do.

The meatballs and zucchini cakes come 3 at a time - this is an awkward number for 2 people as it means you have to cut one in half to share it. It would be better to have 4 of each. Both were a bit dry, as if they had been reheated and were not fresh out of the frying pan or oven. I enjoyed the yogurt with the zucchini cakes.

The Avgolemono soup was a good soup - a bit thicker than I have had in Greece  and less lemony - so it seemed more like a chicken broth made with rice, rather than a lemon soup with a little chicken and egg drop.

The Halloumi cheese was in tiny cubes which were a bit drier than I expected inside. It was beautifully presented, just not as simple as some of the grilled cheese I've had in Greece.

You can have a very enjoyable dinner here, with main entrees or small dishes to share. However, in Greece the food has been a bit simpler, for example the Halloumi was decorated nicely - but simply grilled cheese without the extra spices would have been fine. Read more Excellent experience. Food was prepared beautifully and delicious. Cute seating and decor and staff were very attentive and friendly  We usually like this place but this time it was really bad experience
We shared couple of dishes the fish was dry
We had meat that it was only fat - we didn’t eat a bit and no one asked why when they took the plate
The dessert was really good Read more I wish the food was better as it would be a nice option. Outdoor seating was a plus.  We had a nice dinner outside at Taverna.  I think the inside seemed very noisy, but outside is quite pleasant.  The starters and main were excellent; the dessert was just ok.  Our waiter was very attentive and helpful.  I'd definitely recommend it if you are in the mood for Greek food and are happy sitting outside.  Once again, another fabulous dinner at Taverna. High end Greek food. Sharing is a must. The prices would send restauranteurs in Greece into cardiac arrest, but we are in Palo Alto. ",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/29886999.webp

We shared a fried green tomato to start with charred corn and a lovely sauce, remoulade?  My salmon had a nice crisp crust and was meltingly tender inside.  The chimichurri had just the right amount of heat to awaken my tastebuds.  For dessert, we shared a classic apple tart with vanilla bean ice cream and we were gifted a dense, moist shortcake with creme fraiche and berries.  The nicest touch is that when we arrived, we were given a postcard of a lovely elderly couple kissing on a bench.

The taco are great I little expensive but if come on Tuesday the taco are half off I would recommend if you have some spare money and want a little treat  I was surprised to see so many open tables on a Friday night. I think Puesto is struggling because their food prices are a detractor for people who are used to portions typically served at many restaurants. Additionally, Mexican food is usually cheap so they really need to set themselves apart. We ordered to following:

Enchiladas Suizas - excellent
Shrimp plate - under seasoned,  nothing special
Tamarind shrimp - very good
Quesobirria taco - excellent
Filet mignon taco - very good
Black beans - tasty
Rice - meh
Birria plate - birria itself, fantastic
Esquite - yummy but too much crema on top
Chef’s special salsas - very tasty, 3 of the 4 were spicy

If the service had been stellar, I would be more comfortable with the higher prices. For instance, no one’s tables were being bussed. They tried to bring our desserts while we still had a table full of dirty plates. And we weren’t the only table this happened to. Not sure what is going on at Puesto but hope the can figure it out.

My wife said the ceviche was the best she has ever had and the lamb chops were the best I have ever had. The paella was also top notch.  This is a must go in Half Moon Bay.  Amazing selection of interesting Peruvian foods, beautifully presented and delicious! Great live singers on a Saturday lunchtime. Excellent service. Definitely coming back soon so we can try more of the menu. Also great views of the harbor and fantastic drinks menu - pisco sours!  Upscale Peruvian.  Food was beautifully presented and was delicious.  We've been to their previous location, which we loved, so I wasn't sure how this one would compare.  It's beautifully decorated and still has a partial view of the water. Tables are well spaced so that you can have an intelligible conversation. The services was amazing and we felt very well taken care of.  Great place for a celebration or if you just want a delicious pisco sour on a weeknight! Read more Phenomenal food with fantastic service. A trusted staple in Half Moon May!  I really really wanted to really like La Castanera again since they moved. Last went when they were in their previous location. A few miles north. My two experiences when I went there were amazing. So I decided to try them again in their new location. Unfortunately it was a huge huge disappointment. The staff were very friendly, the restaurant inside was nice, with a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, the food part of things, which is kind of important, was very very disappointing. First off, it took us forever to get our food. And it was early enough in the evening where this should not have happened. The only decent part of our meal were the appetizers, the empanadas. They were delicious. Unfortunately, our main courses were very bland tasting, room temperature when they arrived, And the portions were ridiculously small for what we had to pay for. I mean 30 something dollars for four pieces of meat. A single scoop of rice and about 10 french fries. My sons chicken on a skewer were two small pieces and a fourth cut piece of potato. No flavor whatsoever. Again. I really wanted to Re-fall in love with this place again since they moved, but no way, not worth it at all. You know you're kind of in trouble when the best part of your meal is your beer, and an appetizer.  Sorry but I won't be coming back. Read more La Costanera is a shadow of what it once was. The service has become mediocre, and the authentic Peruvian flavors that once defined the cuisine are now missing. While the location remains attractive, it no longer carries the elegance and charm of the previous venue. Given the high prices, there's a pressing need for improvement. Once a Michelin-starred establishment, it's hard to imagine them reclaiming that honor without significant changes. Read more Had a great birthday experience. Good food and service  Weird check in with hostess and host. Then the server was absent for awhile. NGood food. Fun wine. Not crazy busy either.  Our Anniversary dinner at La Costanera was amazing! Everything sounded so good, so we ordered a bunch of “small” plates to share and taste everything, we were too full and had to take a lot home, including dessert! Surprisingly, my favorite thing was the stuffed avocado! It was topped with a mildly spicy chicken/chicharrones and this yummy sauce, with microgreens. They should call this place “Sauce”,  because the expertly thought out sauces and drizzles on every little detail make every item on the menu absolute perfection!

We’ve been here a few times, twice this year for Valentine’s Day & our Anniversary and once at the prior location for a birthday, and…we always leave thoroughly satisfied with the food, the service, and the ambience just lovely right on the water. I am also awestruck by whomever did the interior design on this new location…I say it every time we come but every little detail down to the driftwood-lined wall sconces and mix of patterns and colors with Peruvian influences makes it even more of an experience! Even the mocktails were fancy, plus the Peruvian Pisco specialty and tastings are not something you see everyday.

If you have never been…you must go! We will be back very soon! There is also a cute Italian bakery next door (Meza Luna), local brew house, harbor activities near by, fish market and lots of activities. It is the place to be, with lots of easy parking.

We asked that they substitute mashed potatoes, but they accidently gave us veggies instead. We accepted that but since we ordered a salad before the main course, we would prefer that it came with anything but a salad. Most Italian restaurants serve veal with either pasta or potatoes which compliments the veal much better than a salad. And many people order a salad before the entree.

California oasis: loved it! gin-elderflower is an excellent combo. The egg white Island was fun.

Popcorn - amazing, to die for - savory, mild kick, slightly oily at the bottom

Chicken thigh and tongue skewers - both tender, flavorful - don't be dissuaded by 'tongue'. The texture is a teeny bit different, very tender, excellent flavor

Our plates were somewhat hanging off the edges because the table was small for big plates and an appetizer.  Great flavor, well-prepared food. Ambience is great, we chose outdoor seating and it was pleasant and sunny. Gone are the days of enjoying Mexican food at a cheap price though.  My server was terrible, I had to ask for a straw three times when she brought out my water. She finally brought a straw once she brought out my drink, which was 15 minutes later, but  I wanted a straw with my water first.

While we were waiting, we were inquiring about our order as it took a long time. At that point the server offered to bring chips & guacamole, but she was supposed to bring that out anyway. We should not have had to ask about our order for her to bring the chips & guacamole.

While ordering, I asked to have cheese scrambled with my eggs, and they came without cheese.  When I asked my server about this, she told me they ran out of cheese, at a Mexican restaurant?!  When she should have just admitted that she forgot to add cheese to my order.

When we paid for our meal from the handheld credit card kiosk, she gave us the wrong receipt.  When I asked her about that, she claimed that we paid the correct one, but we had to go to the host stand to get the correct receipt to verify.

When I asked for a to go box, our server brought a very small one that wouldn’t accommodate my food. I had to ask for another box and a bag, and my son ended up getting the bag instead of my server.

The overall experience wasn’t good. I wish I would have gone somewhere else for Mother’s Day.

Nevertheless, service was attentive. Food was sadly mediocre. Bread basket was dry or old. Bruschetta was dreadful with dry bread that tasted like it was leftover stale complementary table bread, and tomato mixture on top had no flavor nor olive oil. Did not even want to eat it, and at $9, I expected a larger amount. Spinach salad was a real joke, barely enough for even one, and it only had 5 pinenuts, a few pancetta bits, and we could not even taste the brandy wine dressing. Pasta with clams was underwhelming, but never had this dish before anywhere else, so nothing really to compare it to, but I would not eat it here again based solely on this experience. Salmon was tasty, but again, it was way overpriced for what you actually get, and it was a bit overcooked; side veggies with fish were also underwhelming. Dessert was okay. Space is very large, pleasantly decorated, clean and not busy and did not feel overly crowded even during the rush times, which is so much appreciated in a pandemic or even post-pandemic world. Loud-ish after 5, but I did not mind that night.

Despite that, the service was quite slow-paced. We sat outdoors on the nice terrace.  We are vegetarian, and there were a few vegetarian options on the menu although they should have more.
We ordered two appetizers and shared the vegetarian paella. The sangria was very good. The appetizers took a long time to emerge.  Te Brussels sprouts were quite tasty but the fried artichokes were tasteless.  The paella, which is pricey, was skimpy and bland.  I can't figure out why they wouldn't add a little more bombs rice to as an inexpensive expand it. (In the case of their Paella de Verduras, that's all it would take to make a more generous portion, although it tasted like they might not have actually used bomba or calasparra rice). I make my own paella often ands teach a Paella-making class and would be happy to give them tips on improving the flavors.
The paella needed salt but there was none on our table and the server didn't return after delivering the paella to our table.  My husband had to eventually go inside to find someone to bring us salt.
When our check arrived we were surprised that there was a 20% tip already added in.  Since the service was subpar, we would have tipped less than that but who actually asks for the tip to be removed--that a very uncomfortable option.  We also waited a long time for our server to return to take our credit card.

Initially had reservations for outside (on the terrace/patio) but since it was cold that day and we had a baby with us, they seated us inside instead.  Food looks  better than it tastes.

We look forward to welcoming you!","Read more “Braised” artichokes served cold, French toast made with no eggs, it was just microwaved chopped bread, medium roast beef sandwich served more raw than rare, polenta was a smooth, sweet corn paste with chunks of corn kernels in it. Our poor waiter tried his best to make decent substitutions but overall the food was so bad I almost felt like we were being punked or pranked. I guess my first red flag was that the place had reservations for every single time slot on a Sunday, prime brunch time. The facility is gorgeous and well thought out. When we went in at 12 noon on a Sunday, the place was practically empty and there was a very strong smell of industrial bleach. We did notice that most of the other parties were like us – with small children. So if you need a place to take your small kids and you’re not going to be picky and you care more about stroller space than anything else, this place fits the bill. I don’t think these guys are gonna last though. It’s such a shame because somebody clearly put in a lot of energy to make the space beautiful and well thought out. I wonder if their chefs quit and they just got desperate and had whoever just come in to make an impromptu, amateur meal, and hope nobody complains. Read more The food was really good and service was great. I just wish it wasn’t too pricey thus I feel it’s a bit over priced, especially for lunch which was when we were there. We didn’t have the live jazz music and the portion was smaller for lunch. 
And I was surprised that they are charging 3% extra if we paid by a credit card. I understand it’s common these days but for a restaurant that priced their food quite high to do that is a bit nickel and dime their customers!
We went there for our 20th anniversary celebration and we noted it on our reservation but we didn’t get any acknowledgement. 😩A simple writing “happy 20th anniversary” on our desserts plate would be nice! Read more The dishes at Fattotia E Mare are all well crafted with special attention to fresh ingredients.  We enjoyed scallops and tomato soup for appetizers and shared Fettuccine Alfredo, Halibut, and Polenta for our main courses.  We enjoyed a bottle of champagne and wine by the glass and  finished with Peach Bread Pudding and Chocolate Lava Cake.

The polenta resembled creamed corn vs Italian style polenta that I am familiar with but was still very tasty.

A great dining experience for a special occasion. Read more We enjoyed the food. The service was excellent. It was beautifully presented, the drinks stiff just as you would want. The cheese platter was delicious and the pastas full of flavor. My husband’s focaccia with cheeses was good but it basically cheese bread. We wouldn’t order it again. The broccoli with garlic chips was the only disappointment. Too undercooked and unwieldy to eat. Read more Always a great experience.  Food, service and dining experience spot on every time.  Came to celebrate a birthday, but no one reacted. The food was not very good, we felt it already at night. I can not recommend this place. The evening was ruined.  Great service and the food was fantastic! I got the scallops and they were cooked perfectly  The menu was not the same as shown on line. Some items were missing. Others were available but at a higher price. The server, when shown the on line prices, refused to honor them. Food was ok but over priced. My granddaughter observed, correctly, that (some) of the people were trying.  The food was quite good. Unfortunately, the service was almost non-existent. At the peak, only six tables, none with more than four people, were occupied. We’ve had nice visits here in the past but we won’t be back any time soon.  First time eating here.

It was very good, with loads of clams and small slices of tender calamari. The price was very reasonable, too.  Thank you for the amazing dinner and wonderful service Mezzaluna!  One of our most favorite restaurants. Best authentic Italian food.  We ordered the margarita pizza and it hardly had any cheese on it. It was pretty much a cardboard pizza with some old decrepit basil on top.

We had an outstanding dinner at Bistro Elan: great presentation, exciting pairings of sauce and protein (scallops and mustard sauce was unusual but highly successful), and fun and capable service.  I do love this little place and recommend it. However, I was not thrilled with our smoked salmon on a waffle appetizer as it lacked flavor somehow, it was definitely under salted and bland, as was my fish dish which I think was cod (can't remember). Salting improved it. However, my spouse's beef dish was excellent with very good depth of flavor and I regretted not getting that, and I tasted my friend's mussel pasta dish and it was very nicely seasoned as well. So there were very good dishes and somewhat bland ones. Still worth a visit for high quality made from scratch food, which is important to me.

First, they got the wrong drink.  They fixed it by making the ""right"" one and giving us the old one.  We were fine.  But then, they messed up on one of the pizzas.  We ordered a half-and-half (pepperoni and onion on one side and mushrooms on the other), but they put all the toppings on the same half, which would have been amusing, but my son does not eat pepperoni or onion but specifically wanted mushrooms.  Rise did not correct (or discount) the errant pizza.

We have been here before with no issues, so this may have been a one-off, but the second error was so crazy that I don't see how the kitchen staff would not have at least thought to ask the server to confirm.

Even thought it was a hot day, there was a nice breeze. The pizza was delicious! The service was warm, friendly and polite. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the servers disappeared after we got our food, and we had to wave them down to get the check.

Food was terrible .  I ordered Amritsari Fish and lamb.   Naan was cold.  Service was slow and poor.  Overall, the food was tasty, though it was a bit difficult to know how much to order. In the end we had three small plates (appetizers), two large plates (entrees), a daal, two naan, and two rice (sides) between four adults. We could have had an additional large plate.

The service was friendly but on the chaotic side. We ordered drinks (two servers tried to take our drinks order) which took quite a while to come; then we had to summon a server over to take the food order. One of the small plates came out quickly, the others didn’t appear till plate one was finished; then our large plates arrived while we were still on the small plates. We felt mobbed: people were trying to take the small plates away, others were delivering the large ones, and at least one (maybe two?) other servers were trying to extract our small eating plates and swap in large ones while at least one of us still had food on her plate! Teething troubles, I’m guessing.

We’re a pretty patient crowd when it comes to restaurant-going, but I worry something is wrong at this restaurant if Thursday night treated us this poorly. The owner did comp our cocktails—and seemed genuinely apologetic for the delay about 45 minutes in—but I still feel compelled to write about the experience because it seemed maybe one member of the whole staff was looking after us. To wit: Our water cups were never refilled a single time.

Hopefully these comments and experiences are taken under advisement by Khazana and major improvements are made. Read more For Palo Alto standards- disappointing service experience.

The staff was so warm and welcoming and dedicated to making sure we had a great time. Totally worth it!  Wonderful sommelier and other staff!  Would go back again and get the full 7 course menu.  This was my first Michelin dining experience. The food and wine were phenomenal. The tasting menu was such a fun experience. Service was great. Plenty of space despite the restaurant being in a house. Would return without a second thought.  The service at the restaurant was attentive and professional, which we appreciated. However, the food fell short of expectations, especially considering the reputation. The fish was unfortunately overcooked, lacking the delicate texture it should have. Similarly, the duck was quite tough, making it difficult to enjoy. While the Wagyu beef was fair, it didn’t live up to the high standards we anticipated from such a renowned establishment. Overall, the execution of these key dishes was disappointing Read more We were celebrating 🍾 a birthday, and Chez TJ was fabulous. The food was delicious and perfectly prepared. The service was impeccable, and the ambiance was very romantic. A perfect evening!  Our experience took ~3 hours and it was an evening well spent! Every dish was a sight to behold. My husband and I each had our favorites among the seafood and meat courses.  I won't say which ones, so as to leave it a surprise; but suffice it to say they were all scrumptious.  The wine pairing was spot on. Ted the sommelier was kind enough to create a modified wine pairing to accommodate my allergies.  We sat outside where the ambience suits the experience -- a serene garden setting,  string lights, hushed tones and well spaced tables.  Service was exactly as it should be for such an experience -- friendly, attentive but not obtrusive.  This is not a 'cheap date' :-).

I'm glad it was at Chez TJ. It was an unforgettable experience for her and whetted her appetite for more experiences. Now my wife and I have resolved to go to have a Chez TJ experience, ourselves.  I hate to give negative reviews, but I have to say I was very disappointed in the level of service we got for the price we paid. The number of  times we were told ""sorry"" was not acceptable. For example, receiving our dish, but having no silverware; being served our food, but no wine for pairing, until just before they took the plates away. I don't want to sound cheap, because while I can be frugal, when I decide to go ""all out"", I do. The fact that this was what I got for going ""all out"" is a disappointment. With that it wasn't entirely disappointing, but this is my true review. Read more Incredible flavors, best service and the highest quality food we have experienced through many cities and countries. Staff thoroughly explained each course and wine recommendations made based on our preferences to best complement.

We kindly ask that you and your party follow our dining limit of 1 hour and 30 minutes on our waterfront tables.
Your time limit starts from your reservation time.","Read more Such a great venue for my wife’s BD!!!   Thanks so much!  I would like Open Table readers to appreciate the service afforded to me while dining at Mistral's in Redwood Shores as I thought it was exceptional and unusual.  Reading the menu, I opted for the short rib entree.  With further reading, I noted that it was accompanied by a pasta dish.  I also noted that other meat dishes came with a blue cheese/potato dish which, at the time, seemed more appetizing to me.  Hence, I asked, if possible, to switch the 2 side dishes.  Later when the dishes were served, I was presented with a choice of 2  separate entrees,  one with the pasta, one with the potatoes.   I can safely say that in my life of ordering meals, I have never been offered this option.  I chose the potato side as it did appeal to me, but, in hindsight, I think the dish as offered on the menu would have been better.  Great food, even great service and willingness to please the diner, a great evening. Read more Had an unfortunate experience here last night. I wanted to do something special for my 50th birthday, especially because I also have a 6 month old son, and it's the first birthday of mine with him. I remember celebrating my Dad's 80th birthday at Mistral and sitting at a beautiful table outside by the water. I wanted to recreate that experience for my family for my 50th. I called Mistral over a month in advance to ask if they could arrange for a table by the water. They said they don't typically put tables out there anymore, but for my party of 10, they would accommodate provided the weather was cooperative. I called twice after that to confirm, and both times was told it would be no problem. Of course, upon arriving at the restaurant, there was no table set by the water. The table, which was in the outdoor patio, wasn't even on the water side, and half the table couldn't even see the water. I told the host that I had confirmed it three times, and he rudely replied that the table is in the patio and that IS outside, and they don't sit people by the water. He finally agreed, reluctantly, to set a table by the water, but said that they don't have heat lamps and don't have lights, so we'd be sitting in the cold and dark. Given the fact that my elderly parents were there, we decided to just stay where we were. Of course it was loud and cramped, and a few minutes later, the lights by the water went on! Clearly, the host lied to try to dissuade us from a table there. To me, the worst part of this experience was the rude host who didn't even try to be apologetic or accommodating.  Had he been respectful and honest, I would have been less annoyed. I also found out later that when my 76 year old mother brought in the cake and asked him to have it cut and served on plates, his response to her was ""we know how to do cake service."" The rude treatment we received was uncalled for, and certainly put a damper on what should have been a pleasant and celebratory evening. Read more Nice decor. Food very tasty  great experience  would come back  Dinner with family from out of town, great view, ambiance, service and food. Thank you Salvador. .  Mistral is a hidden gem.  Staff is friendly, food is tasty and a good value.  Been wanting to try this restaurant forever! Glad we finally made the short drive. Food was delicious and service was excellent. Very nice venue too. Inside and out. Handful of different spaces available for different types of events. The outside patio overlooks the water. Back corner even has a fire pit. Easy to get to. Plenty of parking. Can’t wait to go again and bring the rest of my family. We had the crab cakes, filet, skirt steak, mushroom ravioli, and short ribs. All super super delicious. Filet was a tiny tiny bit dry so will need to order that medium rare next time. Oh and watermelon margaritas, yes! Read more We thoroughly  enjoyed Mistral. We ordered a watermelon margarita and an old fashioned and they were great. Had the crab cakes as an appetizer. Yum! Ordered a NY steak and delicious potatoes, and scallops and shrimp dish (loved it). The ambience overlooking the water is super nice and relaxing. Feels like a mini vacation. Mistral is our go-to for a great dinner and evening out. Highly recommend! Read more Place was quiet because no one was there.  Should have been a tipoff.  Surf and turf was not good.  Pork chop was ok.  Spicy seafood soup was ok.  Setting on the water is the best quality of the place.  I reserve this for a birthday celebration, and I subtly hinted to the server about this being a birthday, and I saw other tables getting birthday wishes, and my table was not.

The service is excellent, and the quality of the food is consistent. We consider this location our second kitchen.  We really enjoyed our pasta dinners, and the service was exceptional.  The only downside was being seated close to the kitchen which was very noisy.  Long virtually moribund, Il Fornaio Corte Madera (IFCM) took to the muddy, boring, heavily red-sauced field of Italian restaurants in Marin County with a limited, special menu of Sicilian dishes.  Such a regional menu hearkens back to the wonderful, bygone era of Il Fornaio's regular ""Regionale"" menus.  The present limited one was a good try, but also left room for improvement.  The plates presented were quite plain, and didn't project the vivacity of Sicilian cuisine and culture.  Arancini, with a traditional mozzarella filling, were not quite cooked long enough to properly melt the cheese.  Pesce spada, served on a well-balanced caponata and perfect roasted potatoes, was not quite as succulent as it could have been, and was meekly sauced.  The Zibbibo offered was thin and insipid, a poor representative of that Sicilian white wine (obviously not a fault of the IFCM kitchen).  But on balance, the menu was a creditable try.  

After years of mediocrity and corporate neglect, IFCM's upward trajectory in the hands of its capable Executive Chef, Giacomo, and affable Maitre d', Roberto, portends well for the future.  

Were IFCM to achieve its past years of luster in the 1990s and early 2000s, it would vastly enrich the Marin County dining scene.  Catch it now, while it's on the ascent. Read more Overall good.

The wonderful summer watermelon salad which I had planned to get has been replaced by 'Wildseed Waldorf Salad""  which is a misnomer.  This was not a Waldorf salad which is a juicy, crisp, moist mix of apples, celery walnuts/pecans, grapes, lemon juice and mayonnaise/whipped cream.  That is what I was expecting.  Instead it was a big bowl of dry chicory with a  very few small apple slices and nuts hidden on the bottom of the bowl.  Hardly edible.  Definitely not worth $19.  Try again on this one Wildseed.

Noise level was acceptable as we sat outside.  
However, the noise level is not 'energetic' but just loud.

We are vegetarians, so we really would like to go there more often.  However, the noise level and music selection makes this restaurant a deal killer for me inside.

First timer and generally a huge meat eater. Fabulous dishes; came away very satisfied. Cocktails were unusual and very strong but still I enjoyed the one I ordered.

hope you can improve that.  I love it here, the service from the hostess to the cooks at the table are great. I come here very often, it’s one of my favorite places and I have never had a bad experience. The food taste great too!!  Had a great dinner at Hana Japan. Loved Chef Carlos.  Enjoyed my birthday dinner with visiting daughter, son-in-law and grandsons. Food was excellent, as was service and prices appropriate for what was offered we all had a good time and a good meal.  Ventilation was horrible - very smoky. Food was inconsistent- shrimp was good as were the shrimp tempura. When we first were seated we were asked if we wanted a drink - that was the only time we were asked. We won’t be back - too expensive for what you get  First customers in the door, so quiet and cool. Our grill chef was a newby but personable and ,I'm sure, will be more polished with experience.  The food was amazing! Don’t hesitate going on a Monday. Wonderful vibe  Made reservations for you 8 at 6:30 tonight. It ended up being seven of us only since one of the guests cannot make it.

The houses was able to find my reservation right away and we waited no longer than 15 minutes for our table.

Our waitress was super nice from the beginning very attentive very accommodating and professional. I did not catch your name that I will definitely recognize her whenever we stop by again. She provided great customer service and decided to sing Happy Birthday for our birthday boy twice.

I've been to this establishment before but this time it was a lot more exciting. A lot of it would have to do with our waitress and our chef was great also his name was Julio.

The price is pretty standard it's definitely up there but the nice thing about Hannah Japan is that they offer a birthday discount which is up to $35. So that always helps.

I did not like that they charge a $3 corkage fee if you bring your own dessert. But overall our waitress did warn us ahead of time and did mention that. We went ahead and accepted the charge and celebrated.

Overall, anytime you go somewhere and the cook makes the food right in front of you it's always a plus. Although regardless of where it is you go when the food is made in front of you you always leave the place smelling like the food itself.

The waiter sorry I don’t know is name But he was so awesome.  Highly recommend ❤️  Nothing was wrong with it loved it food was good service was good  Really nice server/staff. Restaurant was pretty quiet , not many other customers for our late brunch/lunch. Food was ok.  I’ve been to Crete and I love Greek food. This place was great. Very authentic and delicious entrees. I also enjoyed the Sangria with Grand Marnier. We were having a late lunch at 3 pm, so we didn’t have to worry about crowds. We were waited on promptly and just simply enjoyed our meals and the time we spent together. Wonderful experience.  We arrived for our 12:30 reservation on time and were given menus as we were seated. There were three other tables occupied and a few people at the bar. After 20 minutes, I asked the hostess if we could order and she was surprised he had not come by.  Ten minutes later he took our order. 20  more minutes passed before I asked the hostess if she could check on our order (salads)  since we were on a timeline due to having tickets for a play.  I had allowed two hours for the meal.  We were so hungry by the time we got our food-a total of an hour after arriving.  We did get an apology when the check arrived but we felt like we had to eat quickly and just wanted to get out of there.  Also, I emailed the restaurant four days earlier with a question and never received a reply.  I love the food at Opa but this visit really turned me off.   They could have offered an appetizer or something to tide us over. Read more The staff was nice and the food was good.  However, it was not busy at all on the night we were there.  I had the meatloaf, which was wonderful.  My wife had chicken skewers, which she said was tasty but overcooked.  Chicken is often overcooked everywhere.  When we arrived for our 6pm reservation for 5, we were told to wait while they prepared and cleaned the table- we asked for a corner table and saw her grab an extra chair to that area. I then went back after a 20 minute wait and was told that it was going to be prepared but she pointed to a different table where a party was sitting at when we first checked in  but now was empty but had to be cleaned and was asked to wait once again. What is the point in having a reservation if you’re not being seated until 30 minutes later? PlXe a reservation sign at the designated table. This leads me to believe that nothing was initially done to get us seated and this lack of urgency was unacceptable. There were people seated and there was no one in line after our group. Read more Food was excellent. Had shrimp dish for appetizer but only 4 shrimp and not enough pita bread. Requested more bread and received a large serving-more than needed by double and charge was $4. I will go back because the food was that good. Server not knowledgeable about menu or cocktails.

I had to ask three different people for a candle to light my son’s cake. And the restaurant was empty. Dave & Buster’s arcade was super fun and we would come back for that experience. I would absolutely never eat here again, or recommend it to anyone. The service was absolutely horrible and the only thing I could think of was that they announced it was employee meal time while we were eating.

Everything!  From the time we sat down, it was over 2 hours till we left.  I don’t blame the server, but I feel the organization and, production of kitchen nerds improvement on getting the dish prepared quicker. The drinking room was not full either.  Disappointing. We’ve eaten at Paseo many times over the past few years and we really enjoyed the food and the service - creative and fresh California-Mediterranean.

Unfortunately there’s been a change in chefs and along with it a new menu which is frankly more in linewithwhat you’d find at a hotel or club. Very dull. Nothing that would make a client or your 13 year old uncomfortable.

Adding to the disappointment was the preparation. Both the pork chop and the (very expensive) wagyu steak were overdone, approaching dry. The pork chop and the accompanying veg were covered in a sweet sauce - any contrasting flavors were lost. The ceviche was flavorless, no citrus or heat. The scallops were okay. At least they weren’t overdone.

Service was decent, although the servers didn’t ask how we’d like our pork chop & steak prepared - we had to chase down the order and even then it was overcooked. Wine by the glass took over 10 minutes to arrive.  positives were the olive oil shortcake, the fries and the Parker house rolls

Please Please Please improve the menu and the preparation, Paseo is a wonderful space and deserves so much better Read more Consistently excellent cuisine. Warm, friendly atmosphere. And Maya provides exceptional service.  💕  We had a delightful experience at Paseo last night.  We had a 5:30pm reservation so the restaurant was not busy.  Even when it began to fill later the noise level did not interfere with our conversation.  We were quickly greeted by our wait person and made to feel comfortable.  We all had the 3-course prix fixe dinner and were very pleased with our choices from appetizer through dessert.  Food was delicious and well-presented.  Had a glass of Cuvee wine based on our wait person's suggestion and was quite pleased. Read more There was a live music trio that played lovely music outside the restaurant. They weren't too loud at all, which was nice.  We were here for the Mill Valley Restaurant Rally. For the appetizer we had the panzanella salad which was rather disappointing because there was only one piece of bread in it. The flavor was good but I was looking for more bread. For the entree we shared the 2 scallops and the NY strip with salsa verde and potato. The strip was a bit too rare for me but the sauce and potato was good. My husband liked the tender beef. The dark chocolate budino was the highlight of the meal and I wished I could have licked the bowl! Our server was excellent and very friendly. He made it a very enjoyable meal. Read more We looked forward to celebrating our 42nd anniversary here, having never dined at Paseo before.
From start to finish, a disaster.!
We selected the pre-fix meal @$55 per person.
There are few entrees overall on the menu to choose from so we assumed the attention to detail would be there. Couldn’t be more wrong.
Our waitress stressed that we should definitely try their special house rolls in addition. “A crowd favorite, hot out of the oven.” They were just a step above storefront Hawaiian Rolls. A $10 disappointment.
1st course (only selection option) was a Panzanella salad, which took a half hour to arrive. Dressing very plain and croutons stale and tough. A half hour after that our entrees finally arrived. I was shocked to see my scallop dish had only 2 scallops on the plate. Even more shocked that the kitchen had taken one scallop and sliced it in half to give the appearance upon presentation that I had 2, when actually they gave me one scallop for a $55 dinner! My husband ordered the Wagu steak. He provided me half of his, feeling bad. It had a giant tough membrane running through it that I couldn’t cut. His vegetables were “tasteless”.
We rejected the dessert that came with the prefix meal because by this time the entire celebration was ruined. Our waitress was clearly overwhelmed and swamped, excusing the delay each time she zipped past us.
Never again! Read more We called from San Francisco to find out if they had baked oysters for our anniversary.
New person answers said they had the large , big bbq oysters. We cancelled the Buckhouse reservation/thru have the most awesome oysters bingo. !!
But Paseo said they had LARGE oysters.
For the price we thought this was best.
Turns out they were a LARGE disappointment as they were tiny tiny.
Not either the price.
Tuna at $42 we had to send back because it was cold outside as well.
Not the best date. Good bread .
Won’t return Read more Loved it. Took some friends there who are super foodies and they had a great time.  We had a really nice dinner here before attending a show at the Throckmorton Theatre.  The service and food were outstanding - our waitress was incredible.  She knew the menu and the wine list very well.  Outdoor seating on an early fall night was perfect. We were probably a little boring as we both ordered the same thing - the saffron risotto with shrimp.  She provided excellent recommendations for items to try on our next visit.  She kept us on time so that we could walk to the theatre (parking is not easy in Mill Valley, and it's a great idea to park once and walk).

In general, we were pleased with the dining experience.  This is our second visit since the new owners have taken over. Our first visit was dismal and we really wanted to give it another try. We came with friends and they agreed that none of us will come back. I ordered salmon with quinoa, French, green beans, corn, and arugula. It came with arugula forward very little Quinoa and no green beans at all. I think they need to get their act together as in prior years under the previous ownership of the restaurant, The food was always consistent and good. I wish them luck!

Today's experience has caused me to cancel my next reservation.  The online menu is no longer current so ordered a smoked salmon scramble.  The saltiest smoked salmon I've ever encountered.  The ""grilled"" onions were raw and the goat cheese almost non existent.  This was served in a little pan with a 1/2 of liquid on the bottom so quite soggy.  My side of what has always been the BEST tomato soup was chunky, overly thick and a disappointment.  My husband's burger lacked any flavor except that brought by the pickle chips.

Then I asked a food runner, after asking a 3rd time, our waitress turned it on. service was not very attentive and when you are paying $120 for dinner for 2, you expect a little service. Lychee martini was lovely, Happy Boy salad was great, as was the cheesy garlic bread. Cheese is my favorite food, so when I say that the truffle mac & cheese had too much cheese...it had tons. The ""shaking beef tenderloin"" did not say that it was sliced. It arrived sliced in small pieces that were over cooked and drowned in sauce. If you order beef tenderloin, you want a single piece and to be able to taste the meat. I would have liked to have considered dessert but the service was so lacking that I wanted to leave.

Started with a misleading “experience” reservation that promised a $44 brunch per person on Open Table. When we got there, we were told this does not exist. Either we did a la carte or paid $ 89 per person. We went with the a la carte. Food was ok at best, certainly not worth the price. Had some sort of steak and eggs with the stiffest terderloin I ever had. Kids had a burger that tasted good but had greasy fries as a side. Drink were expensive as well.

It took 20 min for drinks and almost an hr for appetizers. Table/plates were not cleaned between servings. At the end of the meal we had to look for our server to ask for the bill.

Friendly and efficient service with good if not particularly distinguished food.  1001 nights ambience was good. Food was average. For the price food definitely was not worth it  Steak & eggs and burger were cooked more than we wanted but delicious none the less. Chicken & waffle looked impressive (breast & thigh).

Loved the artichoke dish and the dumplings! The new location is convenient, too. My only complaint is that it is a little pricey.  Service was extremely poor. They were in a rush to close down and brought our dessert out at the same time as our main course. They should not be taking 8:15pm reservations if they want to close their kitchen down by 8:30 and bring all the food including the desserts to the table by 8:30. The server who brought us the dessert was super arrogant when we told her that we do not want our ice cream to melt while we have our main course.

Service started out slow but improved quickly.  
Where we were seated was very noisy.  Could hear conversations from people arriving and a lot of energy from the bar area.  Service was very slow which was surprising since we were the only patrons in the restaurant for the first 30 minutes or more, then only a table with a few people for another 30 minutes to an hour, and they 'd been open for an hour before we arrived for our reservation.  It took 2 hours or more to get served and get our bill settled.  The bar and banquet room were empty.  The ribeye steaks were delicious and cooked as ordered.  But cooled by the time we received the condiments requested.  The creamy horseradish had barely any horseradish taste.  We tend to prefer verly little horse radish, but this was beyond just mild.  We didn't see any staff to get this corrected until after we started to eat because the food was getting cold. Assistant staff would remove plates and utensil before we were done with them and while we were distracted in conversation.  We repeatedly had to catch her and tell her we were still using certain items. 
 The crab in the crab stuffed mushrooms wasn't bad, but it didn't taste fresh.  It tasted like frozen or canned crab.  The crab cakes were very good.  The cesar salad had a nice mild flavor.  Everyone agreed the lobster bisque was a disappointment - just a bland cream soup.  The chocolate cake was typical of a torte and good.  The cheese cake was bland.  The Creme brulee was delicious. - smooth was a creamy vanilla flavor. Read more We enjoyed a nice family dinner in Walnut Creek, CA  The service was great.  The quality of food was just average.  I expected so much more from what I consider a higher end restaurant.  The T-Bone was tough and tasteless.  The lamb chops were cooked perfectly.  The ambiance was HORRIBLE.  We were seated directly next to three tables of large families with adults and 13 children.  The parents did NOTHING to control their unruly kids.  The wild animals were fighting and wrestling each other on the floor.  The wait staff were trying to control the unsupervised mob.  Management did absolutely nothing to intervene.  

If they are charging the prices for a quality higher end dinner, the least they can do is manage rude guests from ruining the experience for the remaining guests.  POOR MANAGEMENT. Read more The sea bass and crab cakes are outstanding. The drinks are generous. The tables and booths are well spaced apart. Beautiful bar.  Sadly, Ruth's Chris has become outdated. Great beef prepared sizzling well remains its signature -- but the steakhouse a la carte menu that is grossly overpriced has become out of step with variety, value, and epicurean tastes in dining. A $300 bill for three people, with one ordering a hamburger, with no appetizers, no desserts, one potato side, and average entree and wine prices, with undisciplined service and a dated atmosphere, no longer cuts it. Always a special event destination, Ruth's will never be that again, as there are simply too many good places at good prices with good vibe and great food as Ruth's competition today. Sad, but true. Read more The food was excellent. Service was a little slow. Very friendly staff.  My son brought me to Ruth Chris Steak House for a treat, and it was. I enjoyed the food and service.

Was immediately greeted by the host when I walked up the stairs. Very friendly and professional.  Server/dinning room support staff top notch had great attention to details. Ruben our server was excellent. Would check back often to see how we are doing.  He made sure we were taken care of. Dinning room support staff came perfect timing each time to remove our finish plates to setup for the next course. Food was great. Steak was cooked perfectly to order.  Lobster tail tastes wonderful. Only minor issue was the Lobster Bisque might of concentrated a little, it was a bit on the salty side, but still good I did finished the soup.

In the beginning we all did our part, Mama, Luis Jr. and Jesus could always be found in the kitchen, Papa was busy washing the dishes, Carlos and Nancy would help as soon as school was let out and Maricela worked the front desk. We worked everyday from 7:00 a.m. until closing. We are so proud of what we have accomplished as a family run business. We welcome you, your friends and your families to stop by and sample our truly unique home-made dishes, salsas and sauces as well as our hand crafted cocktails at one of our two locations.","Read more We always have a nice time at Casa Orozco.
The ambiance is nice. And good service, despite us having a bigger party.
The food is good (although could be a little spicer), but we always a nice time.  Always an amazing time and the food is delicious. I have the fajitas and my husband had the Quesa Berria tacos. Everything was hot and cooked to perfection.  Outstanding food, excellent service will definitely be back  Good was great and service was excellent. Went to see a band play and it was very comfortable and the food was good. I will definitely be back!  We visit Casa Orozco Livermore frequently for the live music on the patio. We are SO appreciative that the restaurant supports local live music. If they didn't, I don't think we would visit. The Mexican food is marginal, despite having tried numerous items. Our friends always get the fajitas because those are a safe bet. We like the guacamole appetizer and will often only get this b/c we have been unimpressed with our other menu selections, ranging from tacos and enchiladas to salads and soups. The margaritas are consistently weak, especially when ordered by the pitcher. The service is generally adequate. Unfortunately, it was AWFUL on this visit. The waitress was completely overwhelmed, forgot our order multiple times, and finally had to comp us something when one of our orders took an hour to receive! Read more The overall experience was good. We visited on Monday evening of a holiday weekend with a group of 12. Our group was accommodated. The food was good. The tip top margaritas were very good. Unfortunately, they ran out of guacamole. We love guac, so that was the only negative.  The guacamole tasted weird, but chips and salsa were very good. My husband enjoyed his chilii Colorado, And I got a beef soup with bacon and tomatillo sauce, forgot the name. The sauce was good. The beef was kind of dry, even though it’s in soup. So for me, good not great.  An overall poor experience mainly due to service quality. It took almost 30 minutes for the server to take our orders, only checked on our table (less than) a handful of times (like the manager or restaurant owner visited our table more than our server…), and took almost AN HOUR to checkout. We tried to be patient cause it seemed that the host ONLY wanted to seat her section, but sitting for an hour for our server to take our check was actually insane. By the time I was ready to go checkout with another person, our server magically turns around the corner and grabs the bill. Multiple of our dishes were also not great and worth the price. The biggest thing, and even though we understood before dining there,  the gratuity was already included since our party was over 6, and we cannot say the 20% service fee was earned through the service we got. Read more Really good food and service at a fair price. We joined our daughter and son-in-law for dinner during a brief visit. We dined here regularly with all three of our kids when we lived in Livermore from 1997 to 2015. All of the dishes were just as good as they were then.  Absolutely love casa orozco! Food drinks and service are always top tier! My favorite place to go any day of the week. ",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/27354109.webp

This last time we went for my husbands birthday the service was the worst we ever had at any restaurant. We ordered 3 appetizers and one came out and we asked about the other ones and our server kept saying its almost done and by the end of the dinner we still never got the last appetizer. We ordered 2 main dishes and 2 kids meals, one of the kids meals came out first and by the time ￼￼the main dishes came my son was done and my other son was just getting his kids meal. One of the main dishes was wrong and something we never even heard of so that had to be taken back and our original order had to be made. We never got brought napkins, never once was asked about refills on drinks. We talked to the manager who was nice and helped us out to make it right but it was unacceptable that with all the mess up we were there over 2 hrs for just us, a family of 4. Read more Service was abysmal, I even ordered up front for my large party so it would be faster - our party was full by the time the entrees came because it took so long. Few and far between drink refills. Not enough attention. Wouldn’t come back.  Our server was great and the food was great. Will definitely be back  We went through their advertised street entrance  and it was through their kitchen, that should have been the first clue we’d have a mediocre experience dining there. We were a group of 13 celebrating our late sister. The advertised large dishes said they fed 5, so we got 2 of each (4 dishes plus salad and bread) which was a mistake. We had SO MUCH FOOD left over. Which was ok since we could divvy it up between 4 households. That was a minor issue- but our waiter should have advised us. Throughout dinner, several of our party had to get up and get help (for napkins, refills, boxes- each time took a significant length of time and for each we had to ask twice, maybe three times) no one ever checked on us! Even to get the check, we had to look for these guys, and each time they were just hanging out in the kitchen area we passed going in. I say “these guys” because our original waiter was MIA and some other guy helped us. A different guy brought the two beers our party ordered. It was a meh experience. I won’t be going back. Read more great birthday celebration   family style favorite dishes  The portions are abundant. Be prepared to take home leftovers, which is a little awkward because the leftover containers are broader than the width of the bags they are put in so transport is a challenge. Worth it for the reheated lunch we anticipate for the next day but…  The food was fantastic and super tasty. It’s a very traditional Italian restaurant. We all loved and enjoyed it very much.  We reserved an outside table. When we arrived, it was not set up, and we let them know that we were there. No one came to put on a table cloth, bring menus or place settings, not even water. No one came out to us, and we took turns going in to ask for service. Finally our server came out who was just starting the shift. Although the food is delicious, the service needs to be more caring, efficient and welcoming. Perhaps if we ate indoors, we would have had a better experience. It was a beautiful night, and they knew that we requested outdoor seating in our reservation. Read more As always the food was great huge portions. Never leave this place hungry. The service was 100x better than past  The service was not good. Although it was a holiday (Mothers Day) and very busy, the waitress was obviously overwhelmed and could not attend well to her tables. To top it off, she delivered to us the wrong bill (after having to wave her down to get her attention), where we ended up receiving a return check far greater than the amount we received when we initially gave the waitress our cards. Not to mention, my parents are elderly and the waitress showed very little concern for their well being or enjoyment, rather seemed more concerned with finishing her shift.

The restaurant filled up rather quickly and it did get a bit noisy for awhile but that was the only drawback.  We  enjoyed our dinner but it was very very loud . It was hard to have conversation as all the tables were filled and people were all talking so it would be nice to have some sound walls or ceilings to buffer the noise of a crowded restaurant  Great food.

Food was great and service excellent.  Can't wait to go back.  Great food and drinks and Cameron is an excellent waiter!  I made a reservation for Mother's Day.  We attended with my wife and two children.

There was no indication on this website or on the restaurant's own website that the normal menu would not be available.  I checked this menu, and it seemed reasonable for a special occasion.  There were items  there that my very picky son would eat.

When we showed up, we found out for the first time that the only available menu was a fixed price menu at well over $100 / person.   Had it been a normal dinner reservation, and not Mother's Day, I would have left.  However, I didn't want to ruin the occasion for my entire family, so ended up paying a bill of over $600 before tip.

While the meal was of excellent quality, it was not worth the exorbitant price the restaurant charged (particularly since two of us were children), and we would not have made this reservation had the actual menu been presented to us in advance.

I must say that practically all of the food from the 3 out of the 4 entrees, appetizers and even the bread and olive oil with balsamic was very under seasoned. The risotto, bruschetta, shell pasta and even the bread left a lot to be desired. I had to add salt to most of the food and I never do that. The ambiance and interior was excellent.

Lamb Chops $48, Halibut $47, Black truffle shavings $35, Venti Manhattan $38, glasses of wine ~$28+. Then when we went to pay for two people, they have already added the tip. Is that common for Mountain View restaurants or just this restaurant?  It’s common for South Beach, but in this area?

Beyond the price, atmosphere is pretty nice, space between tables is generous, food is served at the right temperatures and portions are proper - not too big nor small.

Lastly, 20% tip added to any size party….AND TAX charged for the tip.  Restaurant is calculating tax incorrectly and making extra money on each table.

The restaurant should have let us know about this earlier. Most of the service was focused on serving the larger party and the large group was super noisy.

Food was unexpected. Delicious! Had chicken sausage with a yummy sauce and mashed potatoes with vegetables on the side. German style! Kolch beer was refreshing.
Nice addition to all the great restaurants San Carlos has to offer.  Excellent service was provided by bartender Sidar and our waitress Bajar. We hope that we got their names right. The food was excellent. Pork schnitzel was very good as was the veal schnitzel, both perfectly fried and non-greasy. The included salad and potatoes also were very good. We only wish that spaetzel would have come with the schnitzels rather than potatoes. There is a wonderful German Riesling on their wine list if beer is not your choice.

Spent $200 for 4 orders of food, 3 beers and 2 cocktails including tip.  Had a wonderful time staff was outstanding. Met both owners who treated me well. Nice atmosphere.  Great ambiance and drink menu.  Their cocktails are elevated and tasty.   Food was pretty good, we just shared apps.  The servers were very nice it just was a bit slow.  Plan for a decent sized check if you are eating and drinking.  Overall would recommend!  Service was unnecessarily slow. Snacks and drinks overpriced for quality. I ordered the meatballs and garlic bread. If the meatballs were homemade I’d agree with the cost, but these were the small frozen variety and should have been half the price, if that.  Restaurant was quite a bit smaller than expected, so a little tight. The cocktails were varied and tasty. The food menu is all small bites. We had hard boiled eggs, spicy sausage meatballs, baked Brie with honey and nuts, bacon wrapped plums, samosas and a charcuterie tower. Every single bite was absolutely delicious. Would definitely go back.  We love this place.  It has become one of our fav date-night spots.  Great drinks by the bartender-- my fav,  Funkalicious. Great small plates to share. And great ambience.  We definitely recommend this place.  This place never misses. Seriously my favorite place to go to for yummy food and drinks! Love the ambiance too. I hope they stay here forever!  Great ambience. Great environment. Slow service, but to be fair, it could have been just one of those nights…  Charges $50 per person no show/cancel fee and only holds reserved tables 10 minutes!  What?

The founding owners are parents Luis Sr. his wife Herlinda along with their five children Luis Jr., Maricela, Jesus, Carlos and Nancy. Our story began when we wanted to fulfill a lifelong dream of opening our own family business. All we had was each other, a strong family bond, a hard work ethic and Mama’s recipes, which we all loved since childhood. In the beginning we all did our part, Mama, Luis Jr. and Jesus could always be found in the kitchen, Papa was busy washing the dishes, Carlos and Nancy would help as soon as school was let out and Maricela worked the front desk. We worked everyday from 7:00 a.m. until closing. We are so proud of what we have accomplished as a family run business. We welcome you, your friends and your families to stop by and sample our truly unique home-made dishes, salsas and sauces as well as our hand crafted cocktails at one of our two locations.","Read more We always have a nice time at Casa Orozco.
The ambiance is nice. And good service, despite us having a bigger party.
The food is good (although could be a little spicer), but we always a nice time.  Always an amazing time and the food is delicious. I have the fajitas and my husband had the Quesa Berria tacos. Everything was hot and cooked to perfection.  Outstanding food, excellent service will definitely be back  Good was great and service was excellent. Went to see a band play and it was very comfortable and the food was good. I will definitely be back!  We visit Casa Orozco Livermore frequently for the live music on the patio. We are SO appreciative that the restaurant supports local live music. If they didn't, I don't think we would visit. The Mexican food is marginal, despite having tried numerous items. Our friends always get the fajitas because those are a safe bet. We like the guacamole appetizer and will often only get this b/c we have been unimpressed with our other menu selections, ranging from tacos and enchiladas to salads and soups. The margaritas are consistently weak, especially when ordered by the pitcher. The service is generally adequate. Unfortunately, it was AWFUL on this visit. The waitress was completely overwhelmed, forgot our order multiple times, and finally had to comp us something when one of our orders took an hour to receive! Read more The overall experience was good. We visited on Monday evening of a holiday weekend with a group of 12. Our group was accommodated. The food was good. The tip top margaritas were very good. Unfortunately, they ran out of guacamole. We love guac, so that was the only negative.  The guacamole tasted weird, but chips and salsa were very good. My husband enjoyed his chilii Colorado, And I got a beef soup with bacon and tomatillo sauce, forgot the name. The sauce was good. The beef was kind of dry, even though it’s in soup. So for me, good not great.  An overall poor experience mainly due to service quality. It took almost 30 minutes for the server to take our orders, only checked on our table (less than) a handful of times (like the manager or restaurant owner visited our table more than our server…), and took almost AN HOUR to checkout. We tried to be patient cause it seemed that the host ONLY wanted to seat her section, but sitting for an hour for our server to take our check was actually insane. By the time I was ready to go checkout with another person, our server magically turns around the corner and grabs the bill. Multiple of our dishes were also not great and worth the price. The biggest thing, and even though we understood before dining there,  the gratuity was already included since our party was over 6, and we cannot say the 20% service fee was earned through the service we got. Read more Really good food and service at a fair price. We joined our daughter and son-in-law for dinner during a brief visit.

This is the 3rd location I’ve tried.  Food quality is excellent, and the portions we had were big enough that we had to take half home. So, the prices seem well worth it. The staff was very helpful and responsive to our simple requests. The atmosphere was friendly and casual.  We have been going to Pacific Catch for years. and loved their wasabi bowl. They no longer offer it and the meal we had as a substitute paled in comparison. There was no part of the meal that worked including the rice. Service was fine and atmosphere in the outside area was still lovely/  Delicious food and great service! We were a party of 9 celebrating a birthday!  No interesting vegetarian options or salads. No specials either. Ice tea options were all too sweet. Menu needs updating.  Not sure what happened to Pacific Catch but there was skin on my husband's sashimi, the ahi in the guacapoke was in big, tough chunks, and the guacamole itself was watery and flavorless. Other dishes were small and overly sauced.

We requested to sit outside because we had our dog with us, and we had to put our dog in the car because we were crammed in a table with two huge outdoor heaters and a pole encroaching on our space (car has dog mode, so he was fine). I think Pacific Catch survived the pandemic but the changes they made to stay afloat ruined them. This was our second mediocre experience at this location.

Will definitely be back  We went through their advertised street entrance  and it was through their kitchen, that should have been the first clue we’d have a mediocre experience dining there. We were a group of 13 celebrating our late sister. The advertised large dishes said they fed 5, so we got 2 of each (4 dishes plus salad and bread) which was a mistake. We had SO MUCH FOOD left over. Which was ok since we could divvy it up between 4 households. That was a minor issue- but our waiter should have advised us. Throughout dinner, several of our party had to get up and get help (for napkins, refills, boxes- each time took a significant length of time and for each we had to ask twice, maybe three times) no one ever checked on us! Even to get the check, we had to look for these guys, and each time they were just hanging out in the kitchen area we passed going in. I say “these guys” because our original waiter was MIA and some other guy helped us. A different guy brought the two beers our party ordered. It was a meh experience. I won’t be going back.

We reserved an outside table. When we arrived, it was not set up, and we let them know that we were there. No one came to put on a table cloth, bring menus or place settings, not even water. No one came out to us, and we took turns going in to ask for service. Finally our server came out who was just starting the shift.

Jacifi describes his menu as a blend of new and old: “You get old-school tastes with a modern presentation.” The restaurant specializes in northern and southern Italian standards like saltimbocca, chicken cacciatore, and risotto. But the eighteen-year-old Luna takes these familiar dishes very seriously. Redoune, partner and co-chef Hafid Tadri, and co-chef Habib Jacifi don’t so much replicate the old standards as define them.

Take the fettuccini with Bolognese sauce. Many restaurants make a Bolognese; few do it well. Like the sly smile on the lips of Leonardo da Vinci’s famous lady, this brick red sauce reveals a depth of character beyond its simple appearance. Carrots, celery, and onions add a layer of sweetness, while bacon contributes a sultry, meaty backbone.","Read more Been coming here for years. Long before it was on the food-scene radar.

To loud. Table for 2 is too small when they bring bread and very large dinner plates. Everything is alcart so the bread and sides are all extra.  We wanted prime rib. However, our conscientious server told us that the only remaining was medium and non medium rare. So, we opted for the bone-in ribeye; the flavor was average. Also, our server was not very attentive, especially when we wanted extra butter for the bread service and when my wife wanted her glass of wine for dinner. We will likely come back to try the prime rib. Read more We were a bit disappointed since Izzy's remodeled.  We missed the booths.
We felt it was overpriced for what we got.  Bread was good, but don't like that it's now a bread service and not complimentary.  Prime rib was great as usual and happy to see I could get a baked potato instead of the Izzy's potatoes.  Creamed spinach was good and the steaks (NY and filet) were good as well.  Visit after remodel - the building exterior is bright, clean and inviting!

We sat in a booth in the bar - so much light, bright and spacious than before I like the addition of the lounge furniture and now outdoor seating- spectacular!

We had excellent service from Sergio who continually checked in and made great menu recommendations- the mussels to share were tasty!

The prime rib was quite tasty and cooked to perfection!  We didn’t hold back on dessert, the key lime pie and chocolate decadence was amazing!  This casual fine dining . It is sorta a kind of over priced outback. The patrons are totally casual with short pants faded t shirts and open toe shower shoes it’s so sad there isn’t some type of dress code . The day wasn’t super hot but for some reason the air conditioning was at full bast and my hot steak that was served turned cold in 5 minutes. Needless to say I was very disappointed in the overall dining experience and would not return . Read more Our drinks were not good. I ordered a Margarita, it was so strong I couldn’t drink it.

We attended with my wife and two children.

There was no indication on this website or on the restaurant's own website that the normal menu would not be available.  I checked this menu, and it seemed reasonable for a special occasion.  There were items  there that my very picky son would eat.

When we showed up, we found out for the first time that the only available menu was a fixed price menu at well over $100 / person.   Had it been a normal dinner reservation, and not Mother's Day, I would have left.  However, I didn't want to ruin the occasion for my entire family, so ended up paying a bill of over $600 before tip.

While the meal was of excellent quality, it was not worth the exorbitant price the restaurant charged (particularly since two of us were children), and we would not have made this reservation had the actual menu been presented to us in advance.

Food: The Grilled Pacific Salmon and the Shrimp & Chips get a big thumbs up on taste and presentation! And the Mac & Cheese was excellent! The deserts all made the perfect end to the meal.
Atmosphere: Was not busy for a Friday evening. Love the openness of the restaurant. Read more We had a 1pm reservation. There was no one there probably due to the 90 degree F temperature. Had not been there in a very long time. The place looked old and in need of a freshening up. The menu was good as was the wine selections.

Appropriate price. Friendly staff. Ambience.  My omelette egg was crispy, brown rubber!  We also ordered eggs Benedict and the eggs were over cooked - the yolks were solid hard!
Don’t know what was going on in the kitchen but everything was over cooked and over fried.  We love BHG however this time it wasn’t as good.  The service was very slow.  There wasn’t a host at the front to check in when we arrived.  The table wasn’t ready even with a reservation.  The restaurant was not busy so I didn’t know why.  After we got seated, we had to wait again for our server.  It took a very long time for foods to come well.  The kid mac n cheese was a big disappointment $12 for a 2/3 cup of mac n cheese.  My 6 year old son wasn’t full on that little portion so I asked if there is a refill and the server said I had to pay for a side mac n cheese.  The rest of our meals were ok.  The salmon was really dried so I just left it.  If the mac n cheese wasn’t that small and they were so stingy with it I would visit again.  Unfortunately it was our last. Read more I made a reservation for a family lunch for Father’s Day. Couldn’t order off the menu!! Buffet only. The food was marginal and desert table was horrible. Won’t be going back.  The Father’s Day buffet, the food was cold and overpriced.  $60 per person for scramble eggs, sausage, bacon and waffles! My first and last time.

Not sure what the solution is but something needs to be done.  We celebrated our 1 Year Wedding Anniversary here. The host was welcoming and sat us at one of the best seats in the house. We were greeted and served by John and his resta staff with delicious food and drinks. Thanks for an unforgettable evening!  My branzio was bland and tasted of only lemon juice. We the reservations indicated is was a b-day celebration and not one dessert was brought out.  It was a very pretty restaurant. The salad was delicious. But, the butternut squash ravioli had big crunchy, bread like crumbs on it like a crumbled cookie and there was no sauce.  They were just floating in oil. It was sweet and gummy. Not very appealing. The service was great.  Great wait staff and food! It was the perfect place for a birthday celebration.  Linguini pasta dish was delicious. Service was exceptional.  They were very on top of informing the kitchen of my food allergies and making sure I was comfortable about what I ordered. ",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/25153561.webp

Good draft beer and cocktail.  Even though we were the best dressed patrons in the entire restaurant, the hostess appeared to go out of her way to give us the crappiest table in the place. My wife’s fettuccine was oily and the cream had separated, giving it the appearance of a dish that had sat under the heat lamp for too long.

I think we had a new cook because he didn’t put on a “ show” when he cooked the meal - not even twirling the cooking tools. He burned most of the  food as in blackened burned.

Tandoori items are delightful and one of my favorite, some are very addictive especially their tandoori fish.

No meal is complete without a sweet ending, and the Gulab Jamun at Kabab & Curry’s did not disappoint.

Very quiet  drinks very refreshing like always  normal for me nice place for meetings...

They had to remake my drink as I had asked for one without an ingredient, but they were fine with it and though it took a while, I enjoyed it. ￼  We came for the experience of the handcrafted cocktails, and to be honest they were mediocre.
￼ I ordered the recommended handcrafted summer cocktail and it was way too sweet so I just asked for a classic margarita and it looks like that on my final bill I was charged for the full price versus the half of crafted cocktails.  We sat in the bar @ lunch time which was quiet & very pleasant. The full lunch menu was available and the openface salmon sandwich with fries was perfect.
Disappointed that 4oz. small pour of the $13 dry white wine not available only an $18-6oz of another variety. I ordered the $19 Paloma mixed drink instead. The Paloma was delicious but not a  very generous portion & served in a short drink glass vs a stemmed glass for better presentation? This is a large restaurant, why do you not have a  wine listed on the menu? Seems it would be a good practice in hospitality to offer the next better variety for same $ if the bar inventory is not stocked or menu listing not up to date?

The paneer wrap was good. Everything else was just average. Quite average compared to other nepali places I’ve been to in the area  The food quality was not at all good. Our waiter was good…  The food was very good and the two waiters were very friendly. However, they were the only two people and there were many tables to serve.  Everything was very, very slow. They weren't able to check on us to see if everything was okay nor to refill our water. It was also difficult to get their attention when we wanted to get the bill; that took another 30 min. The problem was not the waiters but the management's idea to only have two people working in the dining room. Will not be going back unless I have a lot of time to spend there. My friend and I ended up eating over a three hour period and we didn't even have dessert nor did we order more than the first drink. Read more Horrible service.

Great hospitality 
Super Saturday night dinner  We had a wonderful dinner.  The server spent a lot of time helping us sort out what to order given food limitations in our group (no dairy, no gluten, no tofu, etc).  The Momo's were outstanding.  So was the goat curry.  We had a puppy so couldn’t sit inside the restaurant so this review is based on our sole table that the restaurant set up on the sidewalk. It was perfect for us, though, because it felt really private (I know it sounds weird since it was outside in a pedestrian-heavy area) without any noisy distractions. The food was absolutely delicious and the service super-attentive. We really appreciated the recommendations as some dishes were unfamiliar for us and know that we will be coming back to try out more things next time. I also really liked the number of gluten free items on the menu. Definitely a 5-star experience overall. Read more Rara is awesome! Great food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere, what more could you want? From the moment you step inside, you are greeted with a warm and inviting ambiance that sets the tone for an unforgettable dining experience. The decor is cozy and comfortable , making it the perfect spot for both casual outings and special occasions.

Every dish is a delightful blend of flavors, expertly prepared with the freshest ingredients. The attention to detail in both presentation and taste is evident in every bite. The sushi is particularly outstanding, with a melt-in-your-mouth quality that Nepalese lovers will adore.

What truly sets Rara apart, however, is the exceptional service. The staff is attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about ensuring that every guest has a memorable experience. They are more than happy to offer recommendations and accommodate any dietary preferences or restrictions, with many vegan and vegetarian options.

Salad did not have any distinct flavor and had a lot of lettuce.  The brisket was very tender but again, lacked of any flavor.  The cheesecake was good.  We did have appetizers.  They label that part of the menu as ""For the Table"" which connotates several items.  We ordered the cornbread skillet which was a small loaf of cornbread we could share among the table.

I was very excited to try this restaurant with my partner as it seemed to have an interesting Asian influence. Drinks were great, we had two cocktails and they had interesting, unique flavors. For appetizers, we had the hamachi crudo and the cornbread. Hamachi tasted old/too fishy for sashimi, but I liked the sweet potatoes that accompanied it. Cornbread was super yummy and the butters were a hit! Mains, we shared a caesar salad with chicken and the steak (forgot what it was called). Caesar had toasted croissant pieces as croutons and I wished they chose differently because the dish was rich enough and needed something dry/plain to balance it out. For the steak, we asked for medium rare and it was inconsistent with pieces of medium rare at the ends (which is odd because usually, it should be in the middle at least?), but the potatoes that came with were awesome (though I have made them at home before, so nothing special). It was my birthday so they gave us a complimentary dessert which was a plain mochi donut with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, and sprinkles. It looked like a mochi donut from a store and it was overly sweet with all the sauces/toppings. Also, this restaurant has a more high-end, expensive vibe and they gave me basically an ice cream sundae? I actually would have preferred it if they didn't give me anything at all because it was so random/off-putting. TIP: Ask for tap... this was one of the first restaurants in America where they did the ""sparkling or still"" and then charged me $10 for a bottle of VOSS. Yo, I went to an amazing dinner the other day that charged more and still was just regular tap water. If other American restaurants don't do this, then Adrestia shouldn't start a stupid trend to be fancy.

So in many ways we haven't just crafted a brand, but a mindset. And our guests are the reason for this. And it's because of them we're continually striving to make sure every moment they choose to spend with us counts. Welcome to BJ's, a restaurant with a Brewhouse soul.","Read more Pieookies are the best.  It was a nice evening out.   The food was great.   The service was fabulous.  Great place and great place for family and good food  I booked a reservation for 3 at 7:30 pm by  open table. Reached BJ’s and they asked me to wait. By 8pm I got the table. After getting seated by 8:00 pm no one came to take order at my table till 8:20 am. I asked the server who was serving the next table. He told he will send someone right away. Waited another 10 mins but no one came and we had to leave. Totally Disappointed. Read more Food was great tasting. The calamari portion kind of small and had a lot of battered bits without seafood.
Service, the waiter was training someone. We experience no wait person attention over 30 minutes. Many waters had been out over 20 kmnutes. Waiter never asked if we wanted another drink (we had two IPAs)
Ambience, very busy and a little too loud. We had four of us and talking across the table to the person farest away was challenging at times with the noise level of the restaurant feed music. Read more We used to go to bjs for long time.. yesterday i took my friends to newark location.. They took out many items from the menu. And there was not even 1 veggie option.. we waited almost 30 minutes for the server to start taking the order.. i was embarrassed to my friends because i suggested this restaurant.. hope they get better!!  We used to be BJ’s loyalist but service was extremely disappointing yesterday. We were given a booth and there was water and crumpled tissues under it. We asked it to be cleaned. When they cleaned they mopped the water but didn’t bother to remove the crumpled tissues. We waited for close to thirty minutes for dinner which was ok but right before we were told that the white rice for Jambalaya was finished and now it would have to be served with brown rice. It was too late to order something else …  then when the burgers and sliders came the meat was overcooked for everyone and the chicken too salty. Even the Mac and cheese lookrd very unappealing so I’m not sure what’s happened at this place. Read more The sliders were a bit dry (had better ones at another BJ location. Otherwise everything else was excellent.  We were seated 30min after our reservation. Food came after 30 min. Place is very noisy. Food was ok. Service was ok.  Food was mostly good. It is expensive, so may not be good value for money, but food by itself is good. Service is below part. It took 10+ minutes for us to get water. We ordered main dishes a few minutes after ordering starters and those were delivered before we were not even halfway through the starters.  Plates were not cleared even at the time of delivering the dessert.  Missed one side item and got after reminding. Staff was friendly, but not very attentive overall. Read more Haven’t been here in a few years , but my visit last night was great. The server was on point and I feel bad for forgetting his name . Very attentive, the food was good and delivered in timely manner . Atmosphere was comfortable for a Friday night .

Enjoyed the inside dining but outside looked lovely as well.  Really great Indian food if you’re looking to get close to that authentic taste.  The outdoor heaters did not work. We got cold and requested to go inside.  Delicious, finger licking good food! Loved it!
Great service, personalized and knowledgeable,  First time dining there. Food was amazing, as were the wait staff. I will definitely be back.  Delicious food and staff eager to please makes for a great experience  Beautiful restaurant and ambience.  Lovely service except when they asked us for our table after hour and 15 mins of arriving and barely having had finished all our food and we arrived on time for our reservations. But they were polite so it's ok I guess.  Area is nice too.  Food was tasty but value not as good as other Palo Alto/Mountain View Indian restaurants we've tried.  I wouldn't go back since I know others I like more but if someone is on that strip and wants Indian food or for a quiet lunch/dinner I recommend. Read more Outside table was a pleasant atmosphere. Three of us enjoyed sharing several of the interesting ""small plate"" and appetizer offerings on the menu. Tasty. Never did get around to ordering an entree portion. Note that all food is served with mild spice level unless you order it medium or high spice level. Next time we might try slightly spicier version. Very helpful and friendly staff. Good value. Read more I brought my family here for my mother’s birthday and I was blown away with the service and the food. The street is blocked off and made it difficult for us to drop off our mother and father as they are both disabled/elderly; The staff showed us an easier way to access the entrance. I put in a note on Opentable that my mother is legally blind and asked if she could be seated in a place with brighter lighting and they lit up the restaurant with brighter lighting for her!!! Everyone there was just so accommodating, and I thought that was so sweet of them. The food was AMAZING we ordered veggie curries, sea bass curry, the meat platter, chicken tikka masala, naan, and lots more; everything was so delicious and presented beautifully. I have low expectations for Indian food restaurants to be honest but their ambience was wonderful along with cleanliness. They treated my mom with rasmallai for her birthday and even provided us with plates for her cake we brought in. I was blown away with the service alone here. I highly recommend this restaurant I guarantee it will be the best experience when it comes to Indian fine dining! Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/60426180.webp

For a well established Italian chain, I was expecting good tasty food.  But the food is not memorable, and not up to expectation.  My colleague's beef tenderloin was well done.  My seafood mix ate like just some seafood cooked with no love.  Another coworker's Ravioli came up looking like a mushy mess (plating could have been more appetizing). Disappointing meal.  Will not be going back. Read more The bread, although not complementary, was warm and delicious. We had to ask for more olive oil and balsamic vinegar a few times and each time we got more promptly. My husband had a beautiful and tasty orangy tomato and cheese salad with Kalamata olives. I had the special Rigatoni alla Norma with perfectly al dente pasta, large fried eggplant cubes, red tomato sauce, and a generous dusting of cheese. Dessert was a plate of 4 delicious mini cannoli with pistachios and candied orange dice and the chocolate gelato, which had rich, dark chocolate flavor. Great meal.

Unfortunately my linguini mare was Luke warm. But the other orders of the same thing were piping hot. So don’t know what happened.

But overall, was very happy with the service. Read more The server was the worst part of my dining experience.  We were the only customers in her section.  We ordered margaritas and never got them until a manager stopped to ask us how we were doing and we said we had ordered drinks 20 minutes ago.

Good quality food and drink, great variety of menu, quality wine list, friendly, knowledgeable staff. Tasteful dishes, good environment, nice happy hour deals. For a dinner date, guys/gals night out or business dinner, it is a solid restaurant for all occasions.  My husband loves Italian so for this birthday, we enjoyed a truly lovely meal at Il Fornaio .  Our drinks came quickly and were well made. The beet salad we shared was fresh and tasty but the stars of the show were our entrees.  We've ordered these dishes at here before but somehow they were just super for this meal.  The rigatoni alle vodka has such deep rich flavor -  yummy!  And the terrific burrata con prosciutto is my slice of heaven.  We ended our meal with their wonderful pistachio tiramisu and cappuccino.

Read more We were town for a Dr. Appt and the guy at the hotel said it was a great place to eat.  The patio was nice except for the slamming door that the kids kept running in and out of all during dinner. The Calamari was the worst that I have ever had.

All of the pasta dishes were okay, definitely would not recommend this place or go back. Read more Nice, consistent place to go. Salad was well seasoned, salmon was on the small side.

That said, it was Mother’s Day so we figured that the Lot is a decent place so the food should be decent. It wasn’t. The meat was dry, the sides were lackluster and the service was slow. The staff was polite and respectful, but super slow. All in all, we paid $80+ per person for low level Casino buffet food without much variety. Read more Very disappointing. They charge $80.00 per person for the Mothers Day Buffet Brunch that does not include drinks. The food was just basic, greasy bacon, sausage links scrambled eggs, pancakes, danishes. Mini bagels that were cold, no way to toast them.  Fruit bowl They did do made to order omelets which my daughter in law said was good. NO breakfast potatoes, biscuits, toast. There was a carving station with tri-tip and some kind of Turkey and chicken strips. No sauces for anything. The broiled cod was pretty good with the mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. But the rolls were cold and hard. Cupcakes and cheesecake weren’t bad.  The service was horrible, we asked for water, dude never brought it so I had to go and get it. He didn’t clear plates, he came to the table 3 times. We also had to constantly wait for food to be replenished. We were a party of 7 so they automatically added a 20% gratuity. So the tip alone was $105.00 save your money next Mothers Day if you can’t find a spot come her a meal at home!! Read more This was the worst Mother’s Day brunch I have ever had. The selection of food for 80 dollars a person was horrible. The food was horrible. Nothing had any flavor. The mini bagels were stale and came from a bag. I have had better food from the free breakfast buffet at a hotel. It was a waste of money and we will not be back. Very disappointed in the whole experience.

You can get breakfast anywhere, but when you go to an Irish pub, you would think at 11:30 you could order lunch.  Food was okay, not really what I had hoped for, the steak pie was ""okay"", nothing outstanding, my coworker enjoyed the chicken in her chicken sandwich. The smoked salmon on soda bread was good, the bread was thick and heavy, so the smoked salmon didn't overpower. Ordered the suggested hibiscus mojito, which was well balanced. The server seemed confused about the questions we had on the menu and forgot to bring the appetizer before the entrees, which made it hard when you're trying to eating the warm food.

Service was excellent but even though we ha a reservation, we seated way in the back and in the line of traffic.

The restaurant featured live music and a packed outdoor patio. The staff remained professional and food arrived hot. Had the vegan tofu and chips and it was delcious. A unique aspect was the view of planes taking off and landing at the nearby airport. Overall, the experience was enjoyable and warrants return visits :)  We have been to this establishment many times. It’s never great, but we come for the live music. This particular evening was our worst experience to date. The restaurant was even more poorly staffed than usual, so our orders not only took way too long (45 minutes) but by the time food arrived, it was cold. The kicker was that mid-song the sprinklers went off while the band played. It was frightening. Luckily, attendees reacted quickly and the band immediately unplugged their instruments, so no one was hurt. I’m not sure what happened to their expensive equipment and sure hope the owner did right by the musicians. It was such a disappointing experience. Had it been an outlier, I would have let it go. Sadly, while this was the worst experience, there are many previous ones we could cite for poor service and a slow kitchen. Read more Our reservation was at 6:15 we arrived on time and we were seated 5 minutes later . Got to our table ordered drinks appetizers and dinner being that it was so busy we knew it would take a while. Drinks came and we asked for water as well (no water). Our food came like in  30 minutes but no appetizers which usually come before dinner. The apps got to us about 15 minutes later we sent them back . Then we asked for water it never came. So I went up to the bartender I waited patiently then once I seen that I could ask really quick for some water she told me she was too busy. At that point I asked for the manager and explained to him what had happened he eventually brought some water by that time we had no drinks or water. The band was playing and this was their first set the sprinklers went on shorted the equipment. It was just all bad ! Read more Really enjoyed the Outdoor Seating and View at this venue. This was my first time there. 
The Band Salvage Title plays the best of many Genre's of music so it fit perfectly with the ambiance.  The food was good for the price and drinks were great. The service was a bit overwhelmed since it was really busy so our server didn't fill our water as often as we needed nor returning to see if we needed anything after we ate. We didn't complain but we were comp a drink for they lack of service by our apologetic server. The other thing that was unfortunate was the Sprinkler came on while the band was on there last set (they still had an hour to play) so every thing stopped and there still was more people coming in that ended up leaving. So it shortened a great night.  Other then that it will be a go to place for me! Read more I really want to love this place. The food is great and being at the small airport is really special. They often have live music, which I love. Plus, the servers are friendly.

But, an hour to get food is way too long. This is not the first time. I cannot help but think this hidden gem of a restaurant is mismanaged - staffing, processes or something like that. Read more Awesome food, service and ambience. Perfect parking and band was a bonus.  Awesome food and willing to serve us breakfast paella (which is on the dinner menu).  Great view of the planes.  What a gem.

Brought my husband here for his birthday lunch because he loves airplanes. Our waiter was just terrific. It’s a simple place with simple very homemade fresh food. Had a great time just sitting there watching the planes.

So the food is good and the service was good and it was quiet and enjoyable. Give them your business! Read more The band was great. I could hear it from inside the restaurant with the door open. I was not impressed by service. Looks like they need more help. The scallops appetizer was to die for. I ordered a fish salad and ended up with a fish meal. The waiter then brought the salad on a separate plate when I pointed this out. Not sure if the salad would have been the same or not. I found the fish rather dry. My husband liked his chicken salad but he was charged extra for it though he didn't order avocados with it nor did he receive the upcharged avocados. No real options for a keto meal and there were no side dishes I could have had with an appetizer to make it a meal.  Everyone seemed to be ordering the paella which looked delicious - just not on my diet. Read more Meh all around. Slow service because understaffed.

They sat a table of six people next to us. Clearly, since they were loud from the start, they didn’t seat any other guests in our room. There were 4 of us and couldn’t even hear each other. The other party was cheering and yelling. It was crazy! Finally I asked our waiter who was great if we could talk to a manager. Mind you it was Saturday night, no manager on duty.

Why? Because it is our favorite Italian restaurant and we can always depend on outstanding food and service.  In fact it is our favorite Los Altos restaurant. 

One of us had the Daily Special, Osso Bucco that was absolutely so tender  and served hot.  And the other had their Veal Parmesan which is not always listed on the menu but if you ask for it they will serve it.  If I am not getting seafood I many times will opt for the veal parmesan as it is so tender and a very generous serving. 

Having food allergies I find they are so very accommodating and willing to substitute side dishes or adjust the main course. 

Their calamari as an appetizer never disappoints - always tender and delicious.

We were too full for dessert however their Tiramisu is one of THE BEST!

We also like their selection of wine by the glass. Read more This one of our favorite restaurants, so we decided to take our out of town guest here for dinner.

Thanks!  Pompeii has been a favorite for many years and never fails to delight. If it weren’t such a small restaurant, I’d highly recommend… but if I did, I’d never get a table! 🤪  Outside tables are along the street which is ok. Ambience? No.

There were 4 of us. Only 1 beer 3 sodas. 4 dinners. No appetizers. 2 desserts. Over $200

I had crab risotto. Not much flavor. Others had lasagna (huge portion) gnocchi (just ok) chicken parm ( no complaints.

Just didn’t feel good and local was with price.

Service was very “not rushed”. Bordering on inattentive. Read more Service was great, lovely ambience and delicious Italian food.  Had an extensive variety of dishes and the most wonderful Margherita pizza we ever had.   Highly recommend.

It’s that kind of Italian restaurant, not a fine dining Italian restaurant. That being said, this restaurant is is fine for anybody looking for that type of menu and food.

Pros:
Good ambience, service and people

Cons:
Average overpriced food.
Tried below items:
1. Kache kele shami: It was dry and chutney came with was a very basic green chutney, not at all flavorful.
2. Murgh Biryani: Salt level was low than normal. Chicken pieces were old. Flavors were good.
3. Bagara baigan: Again salt level was really low. Taste was really average.
4. Guava drink (No alcohol): Basic drink, felt readymade Real juice. Couldn’t even drink 1/4 of it.
5. Pyaz mirch ki roti: Dreadful. Dry and hard.

Not worth spending money on food here. Far better options in and around here for a much lower price. Read more I’ve been here several times and enjoy the freshness of the food. My favorite dish is the tandoori sea bass. That said, the Open Table online menu says it costs $24.99, the restaurant website menu says it costs $34.99 and last night the menu in the restaurant had it priced at $40 or $42. I don’t remember exactly but know it was $40+. Someone needs to update these because it comes across as serious false advertising. Last night I did not order the sea bass. Other than this issue, the tandoori chicken and shrimp were delicious. Chicken tikka was a bit sweet for my taste and Peshwari naan was so fresh and tasty. Read more I have feedback about few things:
1. We were a party of 6, so they had joined 2 tables together and kept it ready for us. But the joint of the tables was not leveled. The person sitting in the middle had a difficult time putting the plate in the middle, one table was higher than the other.
2. It was a very hot day but we were not offered the option of ice or cold water. We were directly served room temp/warm water.
3. There were not many people as we went on a week night but still service was a bit slow, not too bad though
4. Appetizers were well decorated and presented nicely
5. Main course had way too much gravy for anyone to finish and way too little Paneer or Chicken pieces. Between the 6 of us we had ordered 2 chicken dishes and 2 paneer dishes. We made sure to ask the waiter if this was good enough for 6, and he said yes. All 4 dish had the same ""too much gravy"" issue. Paneer dish had maybe 4-5 small pieces if paneer in it, same with chicken dish It felt like we were eating just gravy with the Naan. 
6. Kulfi-rabri was too hard/frozen to eat, it should have been a little more softer
Overall the taste of food was good, will be happy if management fixes above issues. Read more Desserts were terrible. Gulabjamun was raw and was returned. Kulfi was icy and extremely frozen, Ras malai was bland  We had a confirmed reservation via OpenTable for 11:30am on Sunday. We arrived about five minutes early and the front host walked in the door the same time as us (in fact she literally walked in between us as we were entering).

The hostess then informed us that the restaurant wasn’t open yet. No problem - we figured we’ll just wait on the side for them to be ready. After about ten minutes the hostess came back and said the restaurant wasn’t going to be open until noon. Waiting nearly half an hour was a non starter for us.

This was very disappointing and not well handled by the hostess. From our perspective, we had a confirmed reservation. If the restaurant can’t accommodate people before noon, they should ensure that they don’t accept earlier reservations on OpenTable. They were clearly in error, and made zero effort to rectify the situation. The hostess is either not empowered to address customer issues or she is not suited to the hospitality industry.

We’ve been here before. And it’s decent, but not great. They are trying to establish themselves as a more high end establishment. While the food isn’t bad, it does not live up to the standards they are trying to portray. There are now a number of excellent higher-end Indian restaurants in the Bay Area that are more worth trying instead. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/25584850.webp

Our server Nathan was very customer oriented & made sure everything we ordered met our expectation!  It was great I went with my family for Father's Day I feel like the food portions got a bit smaller but was still great I absolutely loved it  The server was amazing, but the hostess was really rude she is the firts face that you see coming in to the restaurant.  Our server was the best. She did her best to make our dining experience fabulous  We had a party of 9 and it took over an hour to get our food.  Great experience.Glad that they are taking reservations now.  After having a reservation we still had to wait outside in the sun for 40 minutes for a table that we had to check on 2 or 3 times during our wait. Dr. pepper tasted flat and was never really fixed during the coarse of our meal. One of us ordered a rib eye steak and it came out touch and impossible to eat. Server did eventually take comp that meal. Wasnt the best experience. We have been to BJ's brentwood before and very much have enjoyed our experience until now. Read more Our dining experience was great. The food was delicious.  Angelica was our server and she was absolutely fantastic! She was so helpful and for the amount of people she had to serve, she did amazing. Food was good and all twelve plates came out at fairly good time so we were all able to enjoy our dishes together. Great experience at BJs, thank you!  Overall a little disappointing. Food was not as good as we have come to expect from BJs. Ahi tuna in salad was dry like it was out for awhile. The Arnold Palmer my daughter ordered was just awful, tasted like vinegar was added. Her burger, ordered medium, was very rare inside. Fish and chips were good as were the fries. Service was just okay. It took 10-15 min to be able to tell our server how awful the drink was.  There was a large, disorderly group seated in the middle of the dining area with kids racing around and adults mingling like it was a private party rather than a restaurant dining room.

Chianti Cucina is it the top of our list whenever we wish to go out for an excellent meal in Marin County.  Food is excellent and service is very attentive, but the noise level is quite loud, so if that isn't a concern I would highly recommend it.  It was so loud that the waitress had trouble hearing us.  It was also a bit rushed.  I would say if you want something more relaxing don't go there.  If you are hungry and want a well prepared meal without waiting try this restaurant.  My son & family took me here for my 80th birthday since Chianti is my favorite venue for dinner.Everything was EXCELLENT.Thanks to all for making my birthday a night to remember!  My group of six had a wonderful evening; the food was delicious, and the waitress was very helpful and thoughtful. It couldn't have been better! 
Thank you very much!  We had a great experience at Chianti Cucina! The interior was charming, the staff was friendly, and the food was excellent. I ordered the veal osso bucco ravioli, which was outstanding. My girlfriend ordered a pear and prosciutto pizza with a gluten free crust, and also raved about her food.  We always enjoy this restaurant!  Our food was good, and it arrived VERY quickly.  The dessert (creme brulee) was yummy.  However, it is quite noisey inside the restaurant.  If noice bothers you, I would go early or get reservations for outside.  I am glad that reservations can now be set up through Open Door — so much more convenient!  Wonderful food and ambiance. Service was terrific and the wine was delicious.  The greeter was wonderful.  The crew said hello as we walked in the door.  The wine was amazing and the calamari was delicious.  Our server was so nice and the dining room was really quiet.  We were there on a Wednesday so that may be why is was so pleasant.  Really enjoyed our date night and will go back!  I had the New York pepper steak, and my wife had the halibut. The food was exquisite tonight. The pepper steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the peppercorn sauce was delicious.  Came for dinner. Service was attentive. Started with calamari which is very good and gluten free as they use rice flour. I was told the bread that was served seemed a little stale and would be better if it was served warm. The gluten free pizza crust is very good. I tried the prosciutto and pear. The toppings could have been more evenly distributed, but it was tasty. I’ll probably try different pizza next time. Gnocchi was reportedly good, but mixed reviews on the sauces. The dessert eaters said the almond cake was tasty, but like the bread seemed a little stale. Hopefully both the bread and dessert will be better next time we choose to dine at Chianti Cucina.

Interesting recipes and well prepared  Well I hate to say but the food at Monk Kettle stinks. We had a hamburger which was requested to be rare and came cooked brown, meaning cooked well done. The burger was just not good, the fies that came with it were barely warm and tasted like they had been sitting around. My partner got the brick chicken that was $30 and came with purple potatoes and broccoli rabe. The dish was underwhelming in flavor and had only one strand of broccoli in it. The chicken was dry and over cooked. Beer, (we had 3 beers between the 2 of us) and service was great. For $113 for 2 people including tip we felt like it wasn't worth it. This is our 2nd try at this establishment and we won't be back to eat. maybe a beer. Would love this neighborhood place to be better. They need an overhaul on the food.

What a delight The Monk’s Kettle is! Delicious on point food, over the top friendly service and unexpectedly wonderful ambiance in a great neighborhood spot. We plan on becoming a regulars.  Great to see Monk's so busy!  Unfortunately, it also meant slower service.  It was evident that they could use another 1-2 servers in the dining room.  We will continue to support this neighborhood gem nonetheless, but it could be a turn off for some guests.  Great all around experience! We were treated wonderfully and the service and food was awesome!  Our sever was average.  Took his time bringing milk for coffee.  Check was incorrect.  He did correct though.  Food good, hostess lovely and welcoming.  In the past we loved this restaurant but today the food was not great. The kale salad was flat and the kale was almost inedible, hadn’t been softened at all and was torn in huge pieces.
The veg curry came out 5 full minutes after all the other food was served. The fried Brussels sprouts had granulated sugar on top. It felt like someone picked up the wrong seasoning.

Perfect pre-concert choice with location near performance venues, prompt, courteous service, and reliably delicious food. Tea leaf salad excellent. Not spectacular but fine main dishes.  Wonderful everything! Not cheap, but probably not overpriced for what restaurants cost now.  Great curry, fast and nice service and very close to opera and symphony halls  The Food tastes are delightful.  So many flavors, and wonderful preparation.

Eggplant came peeled and  lightly sautéed yet bursting with flavor. Bravo!  Food was delicious! Seasoned well. Great selection of food. Outstanding service! Will go back.  The food is so flavorful interesting and really delicious. The service is excellent. Our waiter remembered my fish allergy from the last time we were there over a month ago. Great restaurant we’ll return to again and again.  There were 9 of us for dinner so we had a chance to share almost everything on the menu. Everything was great. The dining room is so nice and quiet so it is easy to have a conversation. Definitely going back for more.  Teakwood by Burma Love is my new favorite restaurant in the Hayes Valley area. The food is fresh and beautifully presented, the service is attentive, the ambience warm.  The food is unique and delicious! We had the brunch menu and the platha Birria style was such a great combo. The prawn toast was made with a Chinese donut—also unique! We had the spicy duck curry and the tea leaf salad as well. Portions were a good size for 3 people to share these four items and feel full. We’d go back! ",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/55104751.webp

Great as usual everything tasty service perfect.  Sasa always the best for sushi and everything else  Waited forever for simple wine order. Food was ridiculously slow coming out. Impossible to put together as a meal as it came out in stops and starts. Awful experience. No explaining, just slow or no service.  We had three sushi rolls, which were very expensive, but very marginal in flavor taste and interest.  Waiter and service was great but the food needs a major upgrade for the price that’s being charged.
Not worth going back  Did not bring out more than half our dishes. Had to ask four times and waited about an hour to get everything. No explanation or compensation provided. Food was good but can't recommend going because the service doesn't match the cost  I was disappointed with the Walnut Creek roll, as the soft shell crab seemed ground up into a long dark brown meatball. No taste of crab at all! Our server didn’t offer to replace it with something more recognizable. Bad Sasa!  Great food and excellent service. Can’t wait to go back.  The experience was memorable. The food was delicious and the menu was appealing to everyone and in ways quite unique. The service could not have been better. Our server had a knack for appearing at just the right time. The timing flowed perfectly from plate to plate. We were never rushed nor were we ever just waiting. We will definitely be back soon.

The food was good, but we ordered from the brunch menu and what we all thought was weird was that all of our dishes only came with ONE egg.  What restaurant does that? I mean I’ve never ordered breakfast from a restaurant and gotten a hash and one egg dish? So all 3 of us left somewhat unsatisfied.   We came out to Port Costa to attend a live performance at the Warehouse across the street, so we thought it would be nice to eat brunch here beforehand. But other than that, not sure if I’d make the trek again to eat here.  Maybe their regular menu and dinner is better? Don’t know… Read more This has been one of our favorite restaurants over the last decade.  Post pandemic we found ourselves struggling a bit with some menu changes and the service model.

We were so excited to have a fabulous dining experience and the return of some of our favorite menu items.

♥️♥️♥️ Read more excellent quality of ingredients, nice ambiance, great cocktails and good service  Great food and service, as always. Bull Valley never disappoints.  The menu is outstanding here and always love the cocktails and historic Bay Area unique ambience. We’ve eaten here at least 12 times and the food is exceptionally good and consistent. 💗💗  We had a wonderful Anniversary celebration. Thank you for an amazing experience. Delicious cocktails, cider from pink lady apples, amazing vegetarian dishes, special dessert, thank you!!!!!!  Everything was perfect for our Sunday brunch in the back patio. Feel fortunate this great Poet Costa land mark is still going so strong 50 years after my uncle,  the late John M Domagalski first opened it for business as the Bull Valey Inn.  Current owner manager Tamir knows what he is doing. Young staff are bright & charming without being intrusive. Food Five Stars  3rd year celebrating our anniversary here… so we must enjoy it 😉  We love Bull Valley Roadhouse.  Took my niece and nephew there for their first time.  We were seated out back in garden patio, beautiful and lovely.  The waiter was the best as well as all the staff, kind and attentive.  We started with two wings small plates, a gem salad and caesar salad.  The wings were smoky and one set crispy, both delicious.  The gem salad and the caesar salad were fresh and delicious.  We shared the Nashville hot chicken and the steak and frites.  Both wonderfully prepared and yummy.  We also had the sweet potatoes with chimichurri, lime and crispy scallions - very good.  We had dessert at end, also wonderful and cocktails throughout.  Bull Valley Roadhouse is always great and a real treat.  Port Costa is the full experience as well to just kick around the small town.  So charming. Read more We love BVR for weekend brunches. Great food, drinks and service in a unique setting.

The sharable plates have a diverse array of flavors and textures. Not a bad choice on the menu.  We had an amazing experience at JAKS, which we discovered through OpenTable. I can't believe we hadn't heard about this restaurant for over a year and a half! During our visit, we met Manager Roy, who was very helpful during lunchtime. He gave us an overview of the restaurant, and it was really impressive to learn that they’ve been featured in the San Francisco Chronicle and San Mercury. It’s surprising we never knew about this place before.
The food at JAKS is absolutely phenomenal, offering fresh cuisine with unique recipes that you don’t find elsewhere in the area. Yes, you can find curry everywhere, but not the kind of fresh and unique flavors you’ll experience here. Chef Prakash, who has 18 years of experience at ITC Sheraton, creates dishes that are truly impressive. As a big fan of Bukhara in Delhi from the ITC group, I have to say, the Dal Makhani here tasted just like it—no kidding, it’s true.

JAKS has an incredible menu that most people don’t know about. I’m from Palo Alto, and we dine out a lot, but this restaurant is something special. It offers an authentic Indian culinary explosion to the community. Dishes like Banarasi Paan Chaat, Pani Batasha, Peshawari Tikka, Pistachio Burra Chaap, Goan Jugalbandi Lobster, Awadhi Lamb Shank, Butter Chicken, Basil Paratha, and Rose Kulfi were all seriously good, with excellent presentation.

I couldn’t try their cocktails and beer selection that day because of a health issue, but I’m definitely coming back to enjoy them with my team. The place was packed, and we were very surprised by the quality of the food and the ambiance. We’ll be back soon. Good luck, JAKS, and thank you, OpenTable, for the great recommendation!
